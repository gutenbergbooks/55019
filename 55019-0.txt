PREFACE.


The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly depend
upon the zeal and ardour by which all who enter into its service
are animated, and consequently it is of the highest importance that
any measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation, by which
alone great and gallant actions are achieved, should be adopted.

Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this desirable
object than a full display of the noble deeds with which the
Military History of our country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those who have
preceded him in their honorable career, are among the motives that
have given rise to the present publication.

The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced in the
"London Gazette," from whence they are transferred into the public
prints: the achievements of our armies are thus made known at the
time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute of praise and
admiration to which they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions,
the Houses of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on
the Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under their
orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for their skill
and bravery; and these testimonials, confirmed by the high honour
of their Sovereign's approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.

It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental armies)
for British Regiments to keep regular records of their services
and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been experienced in
obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.

This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His Majesty
having been pleased to command that every Regiment shall, in
future, keep a full and ample record of its services at home and
abroad.

From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations which
chequer the career of those who embrace the military profession. In
Great Britain, where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and
where these pursuits have, for so long a period, being undisturbed
by the _presence of war_, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active service
and of the casualties of climate, to which, even during peace, the
British Troops are exposed in every part of the globe, with little
or no interval of repose.

In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the country
derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed not often to
reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,--on
their sufferings,--and on the sacrifice of valuable life, by which
so many national benefits are obtained and preserved.

The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties; and
their character has been established in Continental warfare by the
irresistible spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the gallantry and
steadiness with which they have maintained their advantages against
superior numbers.

In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders, ample
justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions of the
Corps employed; but the details of their services and of acts of
individual bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.

These Records are now preparing for publication, under his
Majesty's special authority, by Mr. RICHARD CANNON, Principal Clerk
of the Adjutant General's Office; and while the perusal of them
cannot fail to be useful and interesting to military men of every
rank, it is considered that they will also afford entertainment and
information to the general reader, particularly to those who may
have served in the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.

There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served, or
are serving, in the Army, an _Esprit de Corps_--an attachment
to everything belonging to their Regiment; to such persons a
narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of the great, the
valiant, the loyal, have always been of paramount interest with
a brave and civilized people. Great Britain has produced a race
of heroes who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood "firm
as the rocks of their native shore:" and when half the world has
been arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,--victories so complete and surprising, gained
by our countrymen, our brothers, our fellow citizens in arms,--a
record which revives the memory of the brave, and brings their
gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove acceptable to the
public.

Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying the value
and importance of its services, will be faithfully set forth.

As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each Regiment
will be printed in a distinct number, so that when the whole shall
be completed, the Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.




INTRODUCTION

TO

THE INFANTRY.


The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been celebrated for
innate courage and unshaken firmness, and the national superiority
of the British troops over those of other countries has been
evinced in the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery, that no doubts can
be raised upon the facts which are recorded. It must therefore be
admitted, that the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
INTREPIDITY. This quality was evinced by the inhabitants of England
when their country was invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army,
on which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into the sea to
attack the Roman soldiers as they descended from their ships; and,
although their discipline and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing intimidated
the flower of the Roman troops, including Cæsar's favourite tenth
legion. Their arms consisted of spears, short swords, and other
weapons of rude construction. They had chariots, to the axles of
which were fastened sharp pieces of iron resembling scythe-blades,
and infantry in long chariots resembling waggons, who alighted
and fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit or retreat,
sprang into the chariot and drove off with the speed of cavalry.
These inventions were, however, unavailing against Cæsar's
legions: in the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and British courage, being
thus regulated, was exerted to the greatest advantage; a full
development of the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.

The military force of the Anglo Saxons consisted principally of
infantry: Thanes, and other men of property, however, fought on
horseback. The infantry were of two classes, heavy and light. The
former carried large shields armed with spikes, long broad swords
and spears; and the latter were armed with swords or spears only.
They had also men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.

The feudal troops established by William the Conqueror consisted
(as already stated in the Introduction to the Cavalry) almost
entirely of horse; but when the warlike barons and knights, with
their trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although these were of inferior
degree, they proved stouthearted Britons of stanch fidelity. When
stipendiary troops were employed, infantry always constituted a
considerable portion of the military force; and this _arme_ has
since acquired, in every quarter of the globe, a celebrity never
exceeded by the armies of any nation at any period.

The weapons carried by the infantry, during the several reigns
succeeding the Conquest, were bows and arrows, half-pikes, lances,
halberds, various kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of time the practice
became general for military men to be so completely cased in steel,
that it was almost impossible to slay them.

The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the destructive
purposes of war, in the early part of the fourteenth
century, produced a change in the arms and equipment of the
infantry-soldier. Bows and arrows gave place to various kinds of
fire-arms, but British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect bore of
the fire-arms when first introduced, a body of men, well trained
in the use of the bow from their youth, was considered a valuable
acquisition to every army, even as late as the sixteenth century.

During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth each company
of infantry usually consisted of men armed five different ways; in
every hundred men forty were "_men-at-arms_," and sixty "_shot_;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe men, and
thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were twenty archers, twenty
musketeers, and twenty harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides
his principal weapon, a sword and dagger.

Companies of infantry varied at this period in numbers from 150
to 300 men; each company had a colour or ensign, and the mode of
formation recommended by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:--the colour in the centre of the company
guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen in equal proportions, on
each flank of the halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank
of the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were much lighter than the
muskets then in use) in equal proportions on each flank of the
company for skirmishing.[1] It was customary to unite a number
of companies into one body, called a REGIMENT, which frequently
amounted to three thousand men: but each company continued to carry
a colour. Numerous improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found impossible to
make armour proof against the muskets then in use (which carried
a very heavy ball) without its being too weighty for the soldier,
armour was gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse, and the infantry
were reduced to two classes, viz.: _musketeers_, armed with
matchlock muskets, swords, and daggers; and _pikemen_, armed with
pikes from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.

In the early part of the seventeenth century Gustavus Adolphus,
King of Sweden, reduced the strength of regiments to 1000 men; he
caused the gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in flasks,
or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing a charge, to be
made up into cartridges, and carried in pouches; and he formed
each regiment into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming four regiments
into a brigade; and the number of colours was afterwards reduced to
three in each regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that his
infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated Polish horsemen
and Austrian cuirassiers; and his armies became the admiration of
other nations. His mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great was the prejudice
in favour of ancient customs, that all his improvements were not
adopted until near a century afterwards.

In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service, styled
the Admiral's regiment. In 1678 each company of 100 men usually
consisted of 30 pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with light
firelocks. In this year the King added a company of men armed with
hand-grenades to each of the old British regiments, which was
designated the "grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived as to
fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets similar to those
at present in use were adopted about twenty years afterwards.

An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by order of King James
II., to guard the artillery, and was designated the Royal Fusiliers
(now 7th Foot). This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.

King William III. incorporated the Admiral's regiment in the second
Foot Guards, and raised two Marine regiments for sea-service.
During the war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14 pikemen and 46
musketeers; the captains carried pikes; lieutenants, partisans;
ensigns, half-pikes; and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in
1697 the Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again formed on
the breaking out of the war in 1702.[2]

During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were laid aside, and every
infantry soldier was armed with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the
grenadiers ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside their third colour:
the corps of Royal Artillery was first added to the Army in this
reign.

About the year 1745, the men of the battalion companies of infantry
ceased to carry swords; during the reign of George II. light
companies were added to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers should lay aside
their swords, as that weapon had never been used during the seven
years' war. Since that period the arms of the infantry soldier have
been limited to the musket and bayonet.

The arms and equipment of the British troops have seldom differed
materially, since the Conquest, from those of other European
states; and in some respects the arming has, at certain periods,
been allowed to be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage, the bravery and
superiority of the British infantry have been evinced on very many
and most trying occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.

Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like champions who have
dared to confront a host of foes, and have proved themselves
valiant with any arms. At _Crecy_ King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August, 1346, Philip
King of France, whose army is said to have amounted to 100,000
men; here British valour encountered veterans of renown:--the
King of Bohemia, the King of Majorca, and many princes and nobles
were slain, and the French army was routed and cut to pieces. Ten
years afterwards, Edward Prince of Wales, who was designated the
Black Prince, defeated, at _Poictiers_, with 14,000 men, a French
army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry, and took John I., King of
France, and his son Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October,
1415, King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000 men, although
greatly exhausted by marches, privations, and sickness, defeated,
at _Agincourt_, the Constable of France, at the head of the flower
of the French nobility and an army said to amount to 60,000 men,
and gained a complete victory.

During the seventy years' war between the United Provinces of the
Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy, which commenced in 1578 and
terminated in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable spirit and
firmness;[3] and in the thirty years' war between the Protestant
Princes and the Emperor of Germany, the British troops in the
service of Sweden and other states were celebrated for deeds of
heroism.[4] In the wars of Queen Anne, the fame of the British
army under the great MARLBOROUGH was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed within the memory
of persons now living, there is abundant proof that the Britons
of the present age are not inferior to their ancestors in the
qualities which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds of
the brave men, of whom there are many now surviving, who fought in
Egypt in 1801, under the brave Abercromby, and compelled the French
army, which had been vainly styled _Invincible_, to evacuate that
country; also the services of the gallant Troops during the arduous
campaigns in the Peninsula, under the immortal WELLINGTON; and
the determined stand made by the British Army at Waterloo, where
Napoleon Bonaparte, who had long been the inveterate enemy of Great
Britain, and had sought and planned her destruction by every means
he could devise, was compelled to leave his vanquished legions to
their fate, and to place himself at the disposal of the British
Government. These achievements, with others of recent dates in the
distant climes of India, prove that the same valour and constancy
which glowed in the breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers,
Agincourt, Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the Britons
of the nineteenth century.

The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust and muscular
frame,--intrepidity which no danger can appal,--unconquerable
spirit and resolution,--patience in fatigue and privation, and
cheerful obedience to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate and give
a skilful direction to the energies and adventurous spirit of
the hero, and a wise selection of officers of superior talent to
command, whose presence inspires confidence,--have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British arms.[5]
The fame of the deeds of the past and present generations in the
various battle-fields where the robust sons of Albion have fought
and conquered, surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to the end of
time.

The records of the several regiments will be found to contain a
detail of facts of an interesting character, connected with the
hardships, sufferings, and gallant exploits of British soldiers in
the various parts of the world, where the calls of their Country
and the commands of their Sovereign have required them to proceed
in the execution of their duty, whether in active continental
operations, or in maintaining colonial territories in distant and
unfavourable climes.

The superiority of the British infantry has been pre-eminently set
forth in the wars of six centuries, and admitted by the greatest
commanders which Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this _arme_, as at present practised, while they are adapted
to every species of warfare, and to all probable situations
and circumstances of service, are calculated to show forth the
brilliancy of military tactics calculated upon mathematical and
scientific principles. Although the movements and evolutions have
been copied from the continental armies, yet various improvements
have from time to time been introduced, to insure that simplicity
and celerity by which the superiority of the national military
character is maintained. The rank and influence which Great Britain
has attained among the nations of the world, have in a great
measure been purchased by the valour of the Army, and to persons
who have the welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.

the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in
Egypt to that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but
His Majesty desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed
on the consideration of every part of the army, that it has been a
strict observance of order, discipline, and military system, which
has given the full energy to the native valour of the troops, and
has enabled them proudly to assert the superiority of the national
military character, in situations uncommonly arduous, and under
circumstances of peculiar difficulty."--_General Orders in 1801._

In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope
(afterwards Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the
successful result of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January,
1809, it is stated:--"On no occasion has the undaunted valour of
British troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a
severe and harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority
which the enemy had acquired, and which had materially impaired
the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages were to be
encountered. These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the
troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that whatever
advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there is
inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows
not how to yield,--that no circumstances can appal,--and that will
ensure victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any
human means."

HISTORICAL RECORD

OF THE

FIFTEENTH, OR YORKSHIRE EAST RIDING

REGIMENT OF FOOT.


[Sidenote: 1685]

Peace with foreign nations and tranquillity at home, accompanied
by improvements in the domestic and commercial interests of the
kingdom, followed the accession of KING JAMES II. to the throne,
in February, 1685; but few months elapsed before JAMES DUKE OF
MONMOUTH appeared as a competitor to the throne, and raised an army
in the west of England. The King immediately augmented his regular
forces; and among the corps then raised was the regiment which now
bears the title of the FIFTEENTH REGIMENT OF FOOT.

This corps was raised in Nottinghamshire and the adjoining
counties, the general rendezvous being at Nottingham; and the
several companies of which it was composed were raised by the
following gentlemen:-- SIR WILLIAM CLIFTON, ---- COTTER, ----
BAKER, WILLIAM BARNES, WILLIAM DOBYNS, THOMAS FOWKE, JOHN
STANHOPE, ---- WARREN, WILLIAM STOW, and ROGER KIRKBY. SIR WILLIAM
CLIFTON was appointed colonel by commission dated the 22nd of
June, 1685; Captain Cotter was appointed to be lieut.-colonel, and
Captain Baker to be major.

While many loyal men were arraying themselves under the King's
banner, and the several companies of the regiment were making rapid
progress towards being completed in numbers, the rebel army was
overthrown at Sedgemoor, and the Duke of Monmouth was afterwards
captured and beheaded.

In August, the regiment marched from Nottingham to Hounslow, and
pitched its tents on the heath; where it was reviewed by the King,
who thanked the officers and soldiers for the readiness they had
evinced to support the Crown at the moment of danger: it afterwards
marched to London, was quartered for a short period in Moorfields,
and in September proceeded to Carlisle, North Shields, Landguard
Fort, and Scarborough Castle, where it passed the winter.

[Sidenote: 1686]

The King, having resolved to retain the regiment in his service,
fixed its establishment, by warrant under the sign-manual, bearing
date the 1st of January, 1685-6, at the following numbers and
rates of pay (_see_ p. 3).

In the spring, the regiment proceeded into Yorkshire, and was
quartered at York, Hull, &c.

Colonel Sir William Clifton retired from the service, and was
succeeded by Colonel Arthur Herbert, afterwards Earl Torrington, by
commission dated 12th of May, 1686.

[Sidenote: 1687]

The regiment passed this year in the north of England; in February,
1687, it marched to Kingston-upon-Thames, from which detachments
proceeded to Windsor, to mount guard at the castle. At the same
time a grenadier company was added to the establishment.

On the 12th of April, Colonel Herbert was succeeded in the command
of the regiment by Colonel Sackville Tufton, brother to the Earl of
Thanet.

At this period, the following officers were holding commissions in
the regiment:--

[Sidenote: 1688]

In June, the regiment again pitched its tents on Hounslow Heath,
where it took part in several military spectacles, exhibited in the
presence of the royal family; and afterwards marched into quarters
in Norfolk. It once more encamped on Hounslow Heath in the summer
of 1688, and subsequently proceeded to Berwick, where it arrived
in September. An officer of the regiment states in his memoirs, 'I
sojourned two peaceable campaigns on Hounslow Heath; where I was an
eye-witness of one mock siege of Buda; after which our regiment was
ordered to Berwick.'[7]

At this period, England was in an agitated state; the proceedings
of the King in favour of papacy and arbitrary government had
occasioned many noblemen and gentlemen to invite the Prince of
Orange to come to England with an army, to enable them to oppose
the Court. The Prince arrived in November; the King fled to France;
and the Prince assumed the reins of government.

Colonel Tufton, not agreeing with the new order of things, was
succeeded in the command of the regiment by Colonel Sir James
Lesley, by commission dated the 31st of December, 1688.

[Sidenote: 1689]

The Prince and Princess of Orange having been elevated to the
throne by the title of King William the Third and Queen Mary, their
accession was opposed in Scotland, where the Duke of Gordon held
the Castle of Edinburgh in the interest of King James, and Viscount
Dundee aroused the Highland clans to arms. In consequence of these
proceedings, the regiment was ordered to Scotland, in the spring
of 1689; and it was stationed at Leith, as a reserve and support
to the troops blockading Edinburgh Castle, until the beginning of
June, when it was ordered up the country to join the forces under
Major-General Mackay, who was retreating before the Highlanders
under Viscount Dundee. The regiment joined Major-General Mackay
about six o'clock on the evening of the 5th of June; other troops
also arrived, and the major-general being thus reinforced, advanced
against the clans, who instantly retired towards the mountain
fastnesses. The FIFTEENTH foot followed the retreating Highlanders
to the borders of the wilds of Lochaber, and afterwards proceeded
to Inverness, where the regiment was stationed some time.

Captain Carleton states in his memoirs: 'We marched to Inverness,
a place of no great strength, where we lay two long winters,
perpetually harassed upon parties, and hunting of somewhat wilder
than their wildest game,--the Highlanders, who were, if not as
nimble-footed, yet fully as hard to be found.' While the regiment
was at Inverness, the battle of Killicrankie was fought, in which
the King's troops were defeated, and Viscount Dundee was killed. He
was succeeded by Major-General Cannon.

[Sidenote: 1690]

In April, 1690, Brigadier-General Sir Thomas Livingstone, who
commanded at Inverness, ascertained that a general rendezvous of
the clans was appointed to take place at Strathspey, from whence
they purposed descending in a body into the Lowlands; and that two
thousand men, under Major-Generals Cannon and Buchan, would arrive
at _Cromdale_ on the 30th of April; he therefore advanced with the
royal Scots dragoons (Greys), FIFTEENTH foot, and some detachments,
to attack the Highlanders. At dusk, on the evening of the 30th of
April, the troops arrived within two miles of Balloch Castle; they
traversed the difficult defile in the dark, and arriving at the
castle, had the camp-lights of the enemy, on a plain beyond the
Spey, pointed out to them; when, notwithstanding the fatigue they
had undergone, the soldiers expressed a wish to be led forward.
After a halt of half an hour for refreshment, the troops crossed
the Spey at a ford, and advanced towards the camp, when several
small parties of Highlanders were seen attempting to escape
towards the hills, and a squadron of the Greys galloped forward
to intercept the fugitives. The soldiers rushed into the camp and
commenced the work of destruction; at the same time a party of
the FIFTEENTH attacked the enemy's guard at Cromdale-church. The
Highlanders, suddenly aroused from sleep, endeavoured to escape
without clothes, and through the misty dawn numbers were seen
running in every direction, some attempting to escape on any terms,
and others defending themselves stoutly with sword and target,
against the dragoons, and soldiers of the FIFTEENTH foot, who made
great slaughter. Major-Generals Cannon and Buchan were taken by
surprise as much as their men, and the one escaped with his shirt
and night-cap only, and the other without coat, hat, or sword. 'We
pursued them till they got up Cromdale-hill, where we lost them in
a fog; and to me, at that instant of time, they seemed rather to be
people received up into the clouds, than flying from an enemy.'[8]

The enemy had placed a small garrison in _Lethindy Castle_, which
was summoned to surrender; but the Highlanders fired upon the
party, and wounded three grenadiers of the FIFTEENTH foot. Lieut.
Carleton, of the regiment, proceeded to an old house near the
castle, from whence he threw two or three hand-grenades into the
works, which so alarmed the enemy, that they instantly surrendered.
About three hundred Highlanders were killed on this occasion, and
one hundred taken prisoners: a standard, which had been unfurled a
few days previously for King James, was captured. The loss of the
King's troops was limited to a few horses killed and wounded and
five men wounded.[9] 'This happened on May-day, in the morning; for
which reason we returned to Inverness with our prisoners and boughs
in our hats; and the Highlanders never held up their heads so high
after this defeat.'

'General Mackay having received orders to build a fort at
_Inverlochy_, our regiment was commanded to that service. The
two regiments appointed to the same duty, with some dragoons,
having joined (in June), we marched together through Lochaber.
This surely is the wildest country in the Highlands, if not in the
world; I did not see one house in all our march; and the economy
of the people, if I may call it such, is much the same with that
of the Arabs or Tartars. In this march, or rather, if you please,
most dismal peregrination, we could rarely go two abreast; so that
our very little army had sometimes an extent of many miles; our
enemy, the Highlanders, firing down upon us, from the summits of
the mountains, all the way. Nor was it possible for our men, or
very rarely at least, to return their favours with any prospect
of success; for, as they popped upon us always on a sudden, they
never staid long enough to allow any of our soldiers a mark, or
even time enough to fire: and, for our men to march or climb up
those mountains, which to them were natural champaign, would have
been as dangerous as it appeared to us impracticable. Nevertheless,
under all these disadvantages, we arrived at Inverlochy, and
there performed the task appointed, building a fort on the same
spot where Cromwell had raised one before: and, which was not a
little remarkable, we had with us one Hill, a colonel, who had
been governor in Oliver's time, and who was now again appointed
governor by General Mackay. Thus the work on which we were sent
being effected, we marched back again by the way of Killicrankie,
where that memorable battle had been fought, under Dundee, the year
before.'[10]

[Sidenote: 1691]

After its return from Inverlochy, the regiment was stationed some
time at Inverness; where Lieutenant Carleton was rewarded with a
commission of captain in Brigadier-General Tiffin's regiment (now
twenty-seventh foot) for his distinguished conduct at the action
at Cromdale. Defeated on every occasion, and overawed by numerous
garrisons, the Highlanders lost all hope of success, and in 1691
they tendered their submission to King William. A proclamation was
afterwards published, offering indemnity and pardon to all who
should cease opposition to the government and take the oath of
allegiance, before the 1st of January, 1692.

[Sidenote: 1692]

Tranquillity being thus restored in Scotland, the regiment became
disposable for other service; it, however, remained in the northern
districts of the kingdom during the year 1693.

[Sidenote: 1693]

In the meantime, the British Monarch was engaged in war to arrest
the progress of the French aggressions on the continent. The King
of France brought an army of superior numbers into the field, and
gained several advantages.

[Sidenote: 1694]

The allies made strenuous exertions to raise new levies, augment
the strength of their contingents, and to turn the balance of war
in their favour; the FIFTEENTH foot was one of the corps selected
to proceed on foreign service. The regiment embarked from Scotland
in the spring of 1694, and landed at Ostend, marched from thence to
Malines, where it was stationed until the army took the field.

In the beginning of June, the British train of artillery arrived at
Malines, from whence it advanced under the escort of the twelfth,
FIFTEENTH, and Buchan's (afterwards disbanded) regiments, and
joined the army under King William in person, at the camp at
Hertogendale, on the 6th of June. The tenth, fourteenth, FIFTEENTH,
seventeenth, Castleton's, and Lauder's (afterwards disbanded)
regiments, were formed in brigade under Brigadier-General Stuart,
in the division under Major-General Bellasis.

The regiment took part in the operations of this campaign, and the
numbers of the confederate forces were so far augmented, that the
progress of French conquest was arrested, the enemy was forced
to act on the defensive, and in the autumn the allies besieged
and captured the fortress of Huy. The FIFTEENTH formed part of
the covering army during the siege; and afterwards marched to
Dixmude, where they halted a few days, and subsequently went into
cantonments in the villages along the canal of Nieuport, where they
were stationed during the winter.

[Sidenote: 1695]

From these quarters, the regiment was called in May, 1695, to
enter upon the active services of another campaign, and it pitched
its tents near Dixmude, where a small force was assembled under
Major-General Ellemberg; at the same time the main army took the
field under King William. In June, the Duke of Wirtemburg took the
command of the troops at Dixmude; reinforcements also arrived; and
an attack was made on _Fort Kenoque_, situated at the junction of
the Loo and Dixmude canals, with the view of drawing the French
forces to the Flanders side of their fortified lines, to favour the
design of besieging Namur. On the 9th of June, the grenadiers of
the FIFTEENTH, and other corps employed on this enterprise, drove
the enemy from the entrenchments and houses near the Loo canal; and
the attempts made by the French to regain this post were repulsed.
A redoubt was afterwards taken, and a lodgment effected on the
works at the bridge, in which service the regiment had several men
killed and wounded. These attacks produced the desired effect; the
fortress of Namur was invested, and the attack on Fort Kenoque was
soon afterwards desisted from, when the FIFTEENTH regiment returned
to Dixmude.

During the early part of the siege of Namur, the FIFTEENTH foot,
commanded by their colonel, Sir James Lesley, were in garrison at
_Dixmude_, a fortress of very little strength, under Major-General
Ellemberg, a foreign officer. On the 15th of July, this place was
invested by a strong division of the French army, under General
de Montal, who commenced the siege with vigour. Major-General
Ellemberg failed to make that spirited opposition to the enemy
which the circumstances of the case called for: he appeared to view
the progress of the besieging army with apathy; and eventually
called a council of war, to which he advanced several reasons why
the town could not be defended, and proposed to capitulate to save
the garrison, which was agreed to by the majority of the council of
war, although opposed by others. When the soldiers were informed
they were to become prisoners of war, they became enraged at not
being permitted to defend the place, many of them broke their arms
to pieces, and some tore their regimental colours from the staves,
that they might not be delivered to the enemy. D'Auvergne states,
in his history of this campaign,--'The body of the garrison had
the same heart and soul with their comrades which did such wonders
before Namur;' but the soldiers were delivered into the power of
the enemy against their will.

The soldiers of the FIFTEENTH were sent prisoners to Ypres; the
conditions of the cartel were afterwards violated by the enemy; the
British were sent to Arras, Bethune, Bouchain, &c., the officers
were placed in close confinement, and attempts were made to induce
the men to enter the French service.

When the castle of Namur surrendered, the garrison was permitted
to march out with the honors of war; but Marshal Boufflers was
arrested, and detained until the British and other soldiers of the
allied army, kept prisoners contrary to the cartel, were released.
This produced the desired effect; the FIFTEENTH rejoined the army,
and marched into quarters at the town of Damme, where they received
new arms and equipment.

All the officers concerned in the surrender of Dixmude, were tried
by a general court-martial: Major-General Ellemberg was sentenced
to be beheaded, and executed at Ghent on the 20th of November.
Colonel Sir James Lesley, and several other officers were cashiered.

King William conferred the colonelcy of the FIFTEENTH regiment on
Colonel Emanuel Howe, from captain and lieut.-colonel in the first
foot guards.

[Sidenote: 1696]

After passing several months at Damme, and receiving a detachment
of recruits from England, the regiment marched, early in 1696, to
Bruges, where it was left in garrison when the army took the field.
On the 20th of May, it marched out of Bruges, and pitched its tents
along the banks of the canal, where it was posted several weeks.

The regiment served the campaign of this year with the army of
Flanders, under the Prince of Vaudemont; it was formed in brigade
with a battalion of the royals, the twelfth, and Collingwood's
(afterwards disbanded) regiments, under Brigadier-General the Earl
of Orkney; and was stationed, during the summer, along the banks of
the Bruges canal, to cover Ghent, Bruges, and the maritime towns of
West Flanders, which service was fully accomplished.

In the autumn, the regiment marched into garrison at Bruges, where
five regiments of cavalry and eleven of infantry were stationed
during the winter.

[Sidenote: 1697]

On the 13th of March, 1697, the regiment quitted Bruges, and
proceeded to Brussels, from whence it advanced, through the
forest of Soignies, and pitched its tents near the village of
Waterloo. It served the campaign of this year with the army of
Brabant, under King William; and brought into the field forty
officers, thirty-four serjeants, twenty-five drummers, sixty-three
grenadiers, one hundred and sixty pikemen, and five hundred
and eighty musketeers (including men detached). The FIFTEENTH,
seventeenth, twenty-seventh, Collingwood's, and Saunderson's
(afterwards disbanded) regiments, were formed in brigade
under Brigadier-General Tiffin, in the division commanded by
Lieut.-General Sir Henry Bellasis.

The regiment took part in the operations of the campaign; and when
the French commanders menaced Brussels with a siege, the FIFTEENTH
marched with the army, from Waterloo through the forest, during the
night of the 22nd of June, in dark and tempestuous weather, and
taking post before that city, was instrumental in defeating the
designs of the enemy.

After the regiment had been encamped before Brussels nearly three
months, hostilities were terminated by the treaty of Ryswick; and
the efforts of the British monarch, to arrest the progress of
French conquests and preserve the liberties of Europe, were thus
attended with success. The restoration of peace being accomplished,
the regiment proceeded in boats down the canal to Bruges, and
during the winter it embarked for England.

[Sidenote: 1698]

The regiment was placed upon a peace establishment; and, in 1698,
it proceeded to Ireland, where it was stationed during the two
following years.

The respite from war, ceded to Europe by the treaty of Ryswick,
was of short duration. The French monarch, continuing to pursue
schemes of aggrandizement, by which he had long agitated
Christendom, procured the accession of his grandson, Philip Duke
of Anjou, to the throne of Spain,--seized on the Spanish provinces
in the Netherlands,--and detained the Dutch troops which were
in garrison in the barrier towns. These proceedings produced a
violent sensation throughout Europe: the house of Austria claimed
the Spanish monarchy, and declared war against France; the Dutch
solicited British aid; and the FIFTEENTH Foot was one of the corps
which proceeded to Holland on this occasion.

[Sidenote: 1701]

The regiment was augmented to eight hundred and thirty, officers
and soldiers; and embarking from Cork on the 15th June, 1701,
arrived at Helvoetsluys, on the island of Voorn, in South Holland,
on the 8th of July. From this place the regiment proceeded up the
Maese, in small vessels, to Gertruydenberg and Huesden, where it
was stationed two months, and afterwards proceeded to the vicinity
of Breda, and encamped on the heath. On the 21st of September, the
regiment was reviewed, with the other British troops in Holland, by
King William III., on Breda heath, and afterwards returned to its
former quarters, where it was stationed during the winter.

[Sidenote: 1702]

On the 10th March, 1702, the regiment marched out of garrison, and
proceeded to Rosendael, where the British infantry encamped under
Brigadier-General Ingoldsby. At this place, the troops received
information of the death of King William, on the 8th of March,
and of the accession of Queen Anne, to whom they took the oath of
fidelity.

The fortress of _Kayserswerth_, on the Lower Rhine, was occupied by
the French, and this place was besieged by the Germans, under the
Prince of Saarbruck, in the middle of April; the British marched
across the country to the duchy of Cleves, joined a body of Dutch
and Germans under the Earl of Athlone, and encamped at Cranenburg,
on the Lower Rhine, to cover the siege.

A French force of superior numbers, commanded by the Duke of
Burgundy and Marshal Boufflers, made a rapid advance through
the forest of Cleves, and along the plains of Goch, to cut off
the communication of the troops at Cranenburg, with Grave and
_Nimeguen_; when the allied army struck its tents a little before
sunset, and making a rapid march throughout the night, arrived
within a few miles of Nimeguen about eight o'clock on the morning
of the 11th of June; at the same time, the French appeared on both
flanks and the rear, hurrying forward to surround the allies. Some
sharp skirmishing occurred, and the British corps, forming the
rear-guard, evinced great gallantry; they took possession of some
hedges and buildings, and held the enemy in check while the army
effected its retreat under the walls of Nimeguen.

The regiment remained at Nimeguen a short time. Queen Anne declared
war against France and Spain; additional troops arrived from
England; and the Earl of Marlborough assumed the command of the
allied army. The FIFTEENTH foot took part in the operations of
this campaign: the French avoided a general engagement, and retired
from the frontiers of Holland, and the British general commenced
operations against the fortresses in possession of the enemy, on
the banks of the Maese.

The FIFTEENTH foot formed part of the covering army during the
siege of _Venloo_, which town surrendered on the 25th of September.
The services of the regiment were afterwards connected with the
siege and capture of _Ruremonde_, in the early part of October; and
the FIFTEENTH foot was also one of the corps which advanced to the
city of _Liege_, took possession of that place, and undertook the
siege of the citadel. The grenadiers of the regiment took part in
the storm of the citadel of Liege, on the 23rd of October, on which
occasion the British soldiers highly distinguished themselves,
and captured the place in gallant style. A detached fortress,
called the Chartreuse, surrendered a few days afterwards: and
these conquests terminated the campaign. The regiment quitted the
pleasant valley of Liege on the 3rd of November, and marched back
to Holland, where it passed the winter in garrison.

[Sidenote: 1703]

From their pleasant quarters among the Dutch peasantry, the
soldiers of the FIFTEENTH foot were called, in the spring of
1703, to participate in the achievements of another campaign; and
while the Duke of Marlborough was besieging Bonn, they directed
their march towards the Maese; and they were in position before
_Maestricht_, when the French army, under Marshals Villeroy and
Boufflers, approached that place; but after some cannonading and
skirmishing, the enemy withdrew, without hazarding a general
engagement.

After the surrender of Bonn, the allied army assembled at
Maestricht, and the FIFTEENTH were formed in brigade with
a battalion of the foot guards, a battalion of the royals,
and the ninth, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth regiments,
under Brigadier-General Withers, in the division commanded by
Lieut.-General Churchill. The French forces taking post behind
their fortified lines, operations were continued against their
fortified towns, and the services of the FIFTEENTH foot were
connected with the siege and capture of _Huy_, a fortress in the
valley of the Maese, which surrendered on the 25th of August. The
regiment also participated in the services connected with the
siege of _Limburg_, and this fortress surrendered on the 28th of
September. After these conquests, the regiment marched to Dutch
Brabant, and passed several months in garrison.

[Sidenote: 1704]

In the early part of 1704, a detachment of the regiment proceeded
to Maestricht, to take part in the duties of that garrison, while
the Dutch troops were working at the fortifications on the heights
of Petersberg.

In the meantime, the progress of the war had assumed an
unfavourable aspect in Germany; the Elector of Bavaria had embraced
the French interest, and having been joined by a numerous body of
the forces of Louis XIV., he had gained considerable advantage over
the army of the empire. Under these circumstances, the Duke of
Marlborough resolved to lead the British troops from the ocean to
the Danube, and make a powerful effort to change the fortune of the
war, in the heart of Germany.

To engage in this splendid enterprise, which was replete with
important results, the FIFTEENTH foot marched towards the Rhine
in the early part of May, and were joined at Bedburg by the
detachment from Maestricht. The designs of the British commander
were secret; the object, for which the movements were made, held
Europe in perplexing anxiety, suspended the operations of the
Elector of Bavaria, and confounded the French Generals; and the
moment the advance assumed a specific direction, the enemy was no
longer able to render the plan abortive. Arriving in the heart of
Germany, the regiment was formed in brigade with a battalion of the
royals, and the twenty-sixth and thirty-seventh regiments, and this
brigade was posted in the second line.

At three o'clock on the morning of the 2nd of July, the army
advanced in the direction of Donawerth, to attack a body of French
and Bavarians under Count d'Arco, in an entrenched camp on the
heights of _Schellenberg_, on the left bank of the Danube. Arriving
in front of the enemy's position, the attack was commenced about
six in the evening, by a detachment from each British corps, and
the foot guards, royals, and twenty-third regiments. The difficulty
of the ground,--the formidable preparations of the enemy,--and
the steady bravery of the Bavarians, occasioned this to prove a
particularly severe contest; but the determined assaults of the
British soldiers shook the strength and weakened the resistance
of the enemy; and eventually the soldiers of the allied army
overpowered all resistance, captured the heights, and pursued the
French and Bavarians across the Danube, capturing sixteen pieces
of artillery, a number of standards and colours, with the enemy's
tents, and the equipage and plate of the Bavarian commander.

The FIFTEENTH regiment shared in this splendid triumph of the
British arms on the banks of the Danube. Its loss was one serjeant
and nine rank and file killed; Captains Bolton and Lesley,
Lieutenant Morris, three serjeants, and nineteen rank and file
wounded.

After this victory the army penetrated the country of Bavaria, and
the Elector concentrated his forces at Augsburg, where he formed an
entrenched camp. The FIFTEENTH regiment advanced to the vicinity
of Augsburg; but the fortified camp was found too strong to be
attacked with any prospect of success, and the troops retired a few
stages; the Germans commencing the siege of _Ingoldstadt_, and the
British troops forming part of the covering army.

The Elector of Bavaria quitted his entrenched camp, and joined the
reinforcements sent him by the French monarch; the united armies
encamping near the village of _Blenheim_, in the valley of the
Danube.

Commanding soldiers whose chivalrous spirit panted for distinction
in the shock of battle, the British general led his columns
forward, on the morning of the memorable 13th of August, 1704, in
full confidence in the firmness and prowess of his troops. About
mid-day a column, of which the FIFTEENTH foot, under Lieut.-Colonel
William Britton, formed part, developed its attack against the
enemy's right, under Lieut.-General Lord Cutts and Major-General
Wills. The tenth, FIFTEENTH, twenty-first, twenty-third, and
twenty-fourth regiments, under Brigadier-General Row, led the
attack in gallant style, followed by four battalions of Hessians,
and supported by eleven battalions of infantry, and fifteen
squadrons of horse and dragoons. This column proceeded to the banks
of the little river Nebel, and took possession of two water-mills,
which the enemy had evacuated and set on fire; then advancing
through the enclosures, made a determined attack on the French
troops posted in the village of Blenheim; Brigadier-General Row
striking his sword into the enemy's pallisades before he gave the
word "fire." The assault was made with spirit and resolution, but
the brigade was unable to force the entrenchments against the
superior numbers of the enemy; and while retiring it was charged
by the French troopers, who were repulsed by the Hessian brigade.
After repeated attempts on the village had proved unavailing, a
few corps blockaded the avenues; the army traversed the rivulet,
and attacking the French position along the front, engaged in a
sanguinary conflict. The combat of musketry, and the charges of
the cavalry, were continued with varied success; and amidst this
storm of war, the FIFTEENTH regiment had repeated opportunities of
distinguishing itself. Eventually the legions of the enemy were
overpowered, driven from the field with great slaughter, and the
loss of many officers and men taken prisoners, among whom was the
French commander, Marshal Tallard.

The main body of the French army being defeated with the loss of
its artillery and baggage, the troops posted in Blenheim attempted
to escape by the rear of the village; but were repulsed. They
were environed on every side, and being unable to effect their
escape, twenty-four battalions of infantry, and twelve squadrons
of cavalry, surrendered prisoners of war. Thus ended the mighty
struggle of this eventful day. Bavaria was subdued; the German
empire was delivered from the menaced danger; the terrors of the
British arms alarmed the states of Italy which supported the
Bourbon cause; and the tide of war flowed prosperously in the
interest of the allies.

Major Cornwallis, Captain Tankard, Lieutenants Kerr and Simpson,
and Ensign Jackson, of the FIFTEENTH regiment, were killed;
Lieut.-Colonel Britton, Major Armstrong, Captains Villebonne and
Gaston, Lieutenants Barton, Dickenson, and Harrison, Ensigns
Lesley, Hargrave, Edwards, Dean, Patrick, and Dawson, wounded: the
number of non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the regiment
killed and wounded, has not been ascertained.

After this victory, the army traversed the country in triumph;
the enemy abandoning several important cities and towns, which
were taken possession of by the allies. The FIFTEENTH regiment
proceeded through the circle of Suabia, and directed its march on
Philipsburg, where it crossed the Rhine on the 7th of September,
and was subsequently encamped at Croon-Weissemberg, forming part of
the covering army during the siege of _Landau_ by the Germans. At
the termination of this splendid campaign, the regiment struck its
tents, and embarking in boats on the Rhine, sailed down that river
to the Netherlands, where it passed the winter.

[Sidenote: 1705]

In the spring of 1705, the losses of the preceding campaign were
replaced by the arrival of one hundred and fifty recruits from
England; and when the regiment took the field, its appearance and
efficiency were commended by the Duke of Marlborough at the general
review of the army. The regiment proceeded, in the first instance,
to the vicinity of Maestricht,--afterwards marched to Juliers,
from whence it traversed a mountainous country to the valley of
the Moselle, and towards the end of May pitched its tents near
the ancient city of Treves. In the early part of June, the army
passed the Moselle and Saar rivers, and the English general was
prepared to carry on the war in Alsace. The co-operation of the
imperialists under the Margrave of Baden was, however, so long
delayed that the British commander was forced to return to the
Netherlands, to arrest the progress of the French arms in that
quarter. The regiment shared in the difficulties of the retrograde
movement to the Maese; and on the return of the army, the French
raised the siege of the citadel of Liege and retired. The French
had captured _Huy_, during the absence of the army up the Moselle;
but this fortress was retaken in a few days.

The services of the regiment were next connected with the forcing
of the stupendous fortified lines constructed by the French to
cover the territory they had seized upon in the Netherlands. These
lines were menaced by a detachment on the south of the Mehaine,
to draw the French army to that quarter; and were afterwards
passed, by a forced march in another direction, during the night
of the 17th of July, at _Neer-Hespen_ and _Helixem_. The French
guards at these places were surprised and overpowered early on the
morning of the 18th of that month, and the lines were forced with
little loss. The Marquis d'Allegre advanced with a large body of
French, Spanish, and Bavarian infantry and cavalry, but he was
repulsed with severe loss. The FIFTEENTH were in reserve on this
occasion. They shared in the subsequent operations of the campaign:
but the designs of the English commander being frustrated by the
Dutch generals, the forcing of the lines was not followed by such
splendid results as had been anticipated.

[Sidenote: 1706]

After passing the winter in garrison in Holland, the regiment
again took the field in May, 1706, and had the honour to serve at
the battle of _Ramilies_, where the forces of France, Spain, and
Bavaria sustained a decisive overthrow. This battle occurred on
Whitsunday, the 23rd of May. On the morning of that day, the allied
army was advancing in the direction of Mont St. André; when the
forces of the enemy were discovered in position, with their centre
at the village of Ramilies, which was occupied by a numerous body
of troops. Having complete reliance on the valour of his soldiers,
the English general commenced the action, and in three hours the
numerous legions of the enemy were overthrown, and driven from
the field with a terrible slaughter. Many prisoners, with cannon,
standards, and colours, were captured on this occasion.

The wreck of the French army fled to Louvain, and immediately
afterwards abandoned that city and also Brussels. The States
of Brabant, and the magistrates of Brussels, renounced their
allegiance to King Philip. The principal towns of Brabant, and
several places in Flanders, were immediately delivered up, and
others surrendered on being summoned, or in a few days afterwards.
Ostend, Menin, Dendermond, and Aeth were captured. Towns which
had resisted numerous armies for months and years, and provinces
disputed for ages, were the conquest of a summer. After sharing in
these splendid achievements, the regiment was placed in garrison in
Flanders.

[Sidenote: 1707]

During the campaign of 1707, the services of the regiment were
limited to marching, and occupying various encampments. No general
engagement or siege occurred.

[Sidenote: 1708]

In the spring of 1708 the regiment was called from its winter
quarters in Flanders, in consequence of the King of France having
fitted out a fleet, and embarked troops at Dunkirk, for the
purpose of making a descent on the British coast, in favour of the
Pretender. The FIFTEENTH, and several other regiments, marched
from Ghent on the 8th of March, 1708, embarked at Ostend on the
15th, and arrived in England on the 21st; but the French fleet,
with the Pretender on board, having been chased from the British
shores by the English navy, the regiment returned to Flanders: it
landed at Ostend on the 20th of April, and proceeded in boats,
along the canal, to Ghent.

Leaving its quarters towards the end of May, the regiment joined
the allied army, and was engaged in the active operations which
followed. The French gained possession of Ghent and Bruges by
treachery.

On the 11th of July, the regiment passed the Scheldt, on a pontoon
bridge, between _Oudenarde_ and the abbey of Eename, and engaged
the French troops under the Duke of Burgundy and Marshal Vendome,
in the fields and open grounds beyond the river. A fierce conflict
of musketry ensued; and charge succeeded charge until the shades of
evening gathered over the scene, and the progress of the conflict
could only be discerned by the flashes of musketry, which pointed
out the ground on which the battle raged. The French were forced
from their position; part of their army was separated, and nearly
destroyed; but it was preserved from complete annihilation by the
darkness of the night.

This victory prepared the way for additional conquests; and the
FIFTEENTH foot formed part of the covering army during the siege of
the important fortress of _Lisle_, the capital of French Flanders,
which was defended by fifteen thousand men under Marshal Boufflers.
The regiment was in position when the united French forces advanced
to raise the siege, but were frustrated by the superior tactics of
the Duke of Marlborough. The grenadier company of the regiment
joined the besieging army, and took part in the attacks on the town.

When the Elector of Bavaria besieged Brussels, the regiment formed
part of the force which marched to the relief of that city, passed
the _Scheldt_, and carried the enemy's positions beyond that river
on the 27th of November; which was followed by the retreat of the
enemy from before Brussels.

The citadel of Lisle surrendered on the 9th of December; _Ghent_
and _Bruges_ were afterwards recaptured, and the regiment had its
winter quarters at Ghent.

[Sidenote: 1709]

Having reposed a few months in quarters, and received a body
of recruits from England, the regiment traversed the conquered
territory to Lisle, in June, 1709, and afterwards took part in
the manœuvres by which Marshal Villars was induced to reduce the
strength of his garrisons in his fortified towns, to reinforce
a line of entrenchments and forts, in which he expected to
be attacked. This object gained, the siege of _Tournay_ was
immediately commenced; and the FIFTEENTH foot, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Andrew Armstrong, formed part of the covering army;
but when the town surrendered, the regiment joined the besieging
force, and took part in the attacks on the castle. This proved a
desperate service. The citadel of Tournay was celebrated for the
multiplicity of its under-ground works, and the approaches were
carried on by sinking pits, and excavating subterraneous passages
to the enemy's casemates and mines. The soldiers employed on these
works were sometimes drowned with water, suffocated by smoke, and
buried by explosions; and at other times parties of the besieging
force and of the garrison met, and fought with sword and pistol in
these gloomy labyrinths. In these services the FIFTEENTH regiment
had a number of men killed and wounded; it also lost several men
from the explosion of a mine, which destroyed a battery.

On the 3rd of September, the citadel of Tournay surrendered;
and the army traversed the country towards Mons, the capital
of the province of Hainault, leaving the FIFTEENTH and several
other corps at Tournay, to level the approaches and fill the
excavations. Immediately after this work was performed, the
regiment traversed the country towards Mons, and joined the
army, on the morning of the 11th of September, at the moment the
columns of attack were advancing to assault the enemy's fortified
position at _Malplaquet_. This proved one of the most sanguinary
and hard-contested battles of the war: the confident and fierce
attacks of the allies were made against formidable works, defended
with resolution, which occasioned a great sacrifice of life; but
eventually the position was forced, and the French army retreated
with the loss of many colours, standards, cannon, and officers and
soldiers made prisoners. The FIFTEENTH were in reserve on this
occasion, and its loss was limited to Brevet Major Leslie, killed,
and three or four private soldiers killed and wounded.

This victory was followed by the siege of _Mons_, and the regiment
formed part of the covering army. The garrison surrendered in
October.

On the 23rd of October, Major-General Howe was succeeded in the
colonelcy of the regiment by Algernon Earl of Hertford, afterwards
Duke of Somerset, who had served with reputation at several battles
and sieges on the continent.

[Sidenote: 1710]

The regiment quitted its winter quarters at Ghent, on the 14th
of April, 1710, and marched to the rendezvous of the army near
Tournay. The services of the FIFTEENTH foot were this year
connected with the forcing of the French lines at _Pont-à-Vendin_,
and with the siege and capture of _Douay_, which fortress
surrendered on the 27th of June. They subsequently formed part of
the covering army encamped at Villars-Brulin, during the siege of
_Bethune_. This place having surrendered on the 29th of August,
and the French army avoiding a general engagement, the fortresses
of _Aire_ and _St. Venant_ were invested, and taken; and these
conquests were the last important events of the campaign.

After taking part in these services, the regiment marched into
quarters at Courtray, where it was stationed during the winter.

[Sidenote: 1711]

Towards the end of April, 1711, the regiment advanced from
Courtray, and joining the army near Douay, was formed in brigade
with the foot guards, a battalion of the royals, and the twentieth
and twenty-third regiments. It was reviewed on the 8th of June,
at the camp at Warde, by the Duke of Marlborough; and afterwards
took part in the skilful operations by which the enemy's formidable
and newly constructed lines were passed at _Arleux_, on the 5th of
August; and this success was followed by the siege of _Bouchain_,
a fortified town of Hainault, situate on both sides of the
river Scheldt. The regiment formed part of a division of twenty
battalions of infantry, commanded by Lieut.-General the Earl of
Orkney, which took post on the north and north-west side of the
town and river; and it shared in the duties of the trenches, and
in carrying on the attacks, in which services it had several men
killed and wounded. The garrison agreed to surrender on the 13th of
September.

Thus the French monarch found his armies defeated and dispirited;
his fortresses wrested from him, and the victorious legions of the
allies prepared to penetrate the interior of his kingdom; and he
sued for peace.

[Sidenote: 1712]

In the spring of 1712 the FIFTEENTH regiment took the field with
the army under the Duke of Ormond, who had been appointed to the
command in succession to the Duke of Marlborough, and advanced to
the frontiers of France. Negociations for peace having commenced,
a suspension of hostilities took place between the British and
French, and the regiment returned to Ghent; from whence it was
afterwards removed to Dunkirk, the French monarch having agreed to
deliver up that fortress until the treaty of peace was concluded.

[Sidenote: 1713]

[Sidenote: 1714]

The regiment was stationed at Dunkirk in 1713, and at Nieuport in
the early part of 1714.

While the regiment was in Flanders, the decease of Queen Anne, and
the accession of King George I., occurred, on the 1st of August,
1714, and soon afterwards the FIFTEENTH foot, and several other
corps, were ordered to return to England.

[Sidenote: 1715]

On the 8th of February, 1715, the Earl of Hertford was promoted to
the colonelcy of the second troop (now second regiment) of life
guards, and was succeeded in the command of the FIFTEENTH foot by
Colonel Harry Harrison.

[Sidenote: 1716]

The regiment was actively employed in South Britain during the
troubles in 1715; but it was not called upon to take the field
against the rebels under the Earl of Mar, who were dispersed, in
the beginning of 1716, by the King's troops under the Duke of
Argyle.

[Sidenote: 1719]

In 1719, the regiment was stationed in Scotland, when the King of
Spain fitted out an armament for the invasion of Great Britain
in favour of the Pretender. The Spanish fleet was dispersed by
a storm; two ships, however, arrived on the coast of Scotland,
and four hundred Spaniards and about a hundred Scots and English
gentlemen, landed on the 27th of April, at Kintail, and were
afterwards joined by about fifteen hundred Highlanders. Against
this force, three troops of the Greys, and the eleventh,
fourteenth, and FIFTEENTH regiments of foot, marched from Inverness
on the 5th of June, under Major-General Wightman, and encountered
the rebels on the 10th of that month, at the pass of _Glenshiel_;
when the Spaniards and Highlanders withdrew a short distance, and
formed for battle on the romantic mountain scenery in the pass of
Strachell. About five o'clock in the afternoon, the grenadiers of
the three regiments climbed the rocky crags, and commenced the
action; they were followed by the eleventh, and a detachment of
the FIFTEENTH under Colonel Harrison; at the same time, the Greys
galloped forward along the road; and the Spaniards and Highlanders
were forced from the lofty ground on which they had taken post.
The rebels made a second stand on the top of the hill, but were
speedily driven from thence. The Highlanders afterwards dispersed
to their homes, and on the following day, the Spaniards surrendered
prisoners of war.

[Sidenote: 1727]

On the appearance of a continental war, in 1727, the regiment was
augmented, and held in readiness to proceed to Holland, but no
embarkation took place.

[Sidenote: 1728]

King George II. reviewed the second and FIFTEENTH regiments in
brigade on Blackheath, on the 29th of June, 1728, and expressed
his high approbation of their appearance and movements. The signs
of war disappearing, the establishment was afterwards reduced.

[Sidenote: 1739]

When hostilities commenced between Great Britain and Spain, in
1739, the establishment was again augmented.

[Sidenote: 1740]

In the middle of June, 1740, the FIFTEENTH, twenty-fourth,
twenty-seventh regiments, and the six battalions of marines, were
encamped on the Isle of Wight, under the orders of General Lord
Cathcart. Towards the end of July, the camp broke up, and the
FIFTEENTH, and twenty-fourth regiments, and the six regiments of
marines, embarked on board the fleet for the West Indies. Some
delay occurred, and after putting to sea, the fleet was twice
driven back by contrary winds; on the 26th of October it sailed a
third time, and was dispersed by a tempest in the Bay of Biscay;
but the greater part of the vessels were recollected and proceeded
on the voyage. Arriving at Dominica to provide wood and water,
the troops lost their gallant leader, General Lord Cathcart (then
colonel of the sixth dragoon guards or Carabineers), who died of
dysentery; and the command devolved on Brigadier-General Thomas
Wentworth.

[Sidenote: 1741]

The expedition arrived at Jamaica in January, 1741, and the
appearance of this force dispelled the apprehension of an attack on
that island by the combined fleets of France and Spain, and also
enabled the British commanders to act offensively. The expedition
put to sea, and after some delay, an attack on _Carthagena_, the
capital of a wealthy province in the country of Terra Firma, in
South America, was resolved upon. This place was found strongly
fortified, and the garrison reinforced by the crews of a squadron
of large ships; at the same time the season for active service in
that part of the world was fast passing away; but the design was
persevered in, and the fleet having silenced several small forts,
the FIFTEENTH mustering one thousand officers and soldiers, and
several other corps, landed on an island near the mouth of the
harbour, on the 10th of March, and commenced the siege of the
principal fort, or castle, called _Bocca-chica_. On the evening
of the 25th of March, the grenadiers of the FIFTEENTH, and other
regiments, mounted the breach in gallant style, to storm the
fortress, when the Spanish garrison fled, and the place was
captured without loss.

Channels having been made through the sunk vessels with which the
Spaniards had blocked up the entrance to the harbour, the FIFTEENTH
and twenty-fourth re-embarked, and commenced landing near the
city of Carthagena. From the place of landing, the two regiments
advanced along a defile, preceded by the grenadiers, through a
country covered with trees and herbage of luxuriant growth, the
interwoven branches forming a shelter impenetrable both to heat
and light, and several men were wounded by shots fired from the
tracks and openings into the wood. Diverging from the defile, the
two regiments encountered a body of Spaniards advantageously posted
to dispute the passage, but as the grenadiers sprang forward to
commence the attack, the enemy fled. The two regiments proceeded to
the vicinity of the castle of _St. Lazar_, which commands the town,
and were followed by the six battalions of marines. The soldiers
passed three nights in the open air, for want of tents and tools,
and their health was seriously injured.

The siege of the castle was commenced; and as the men were
fast decreasing in numbers from the effects of hard duty and
climate, Brigadier-General Wentworth was induced to attack the
place by escalade, to which dangerous enterprise he was urged
by Vice-Admiral Vernon. Twelve hundred men stormed the enemy's
entrenchments under the walls of the fort, exposed to a heavy fire
of musketry. The grenadiers, led by Colonel Grant, rushed forward
with astonishing bravery, and leaping into the lines, carried the
works in gallant style. The Spaniards fled over a drawbridge into
the fort. The British pursued, and called for ladders to storm the
fort; but the fire was so hot, that the Americans who carried the
ladders threw them down and fled. Meanwhile the storming party was
exposed to a destructive fire. At length three ladders were brought
forward, and a serjeant and ten grenadiers mounted the walls, but
were instantly cut to pieces, excepting the serjeant, who saved
himself by leaping down again. Several of the ladders were found
too short: it was ascertained that, owing to a guide having been
killed, the attack had been made on the strongest part of the
works; Colonel Grant fell mortally wounded; and after sustaining
a most destructive fire for several hours with intrepidity and
perseverance, the troops were ordered to retire, having sustained a
severe loss in killed and wounded.

Violent periodical rains commenced; the country was deluged with
water, and the change of atmosphere produced fatal effects on the
health of the men, who were drenched with rain. All hope of further
success immediately vanished, and the troops returned on board
the fleet, where numbers died from the distempers peculiar to the
climate.

The forts of the harbour of Carthagena having been demolished, the
fleet sailed to Jamaica. The FIFTEENTH, and several other corps,
afterwards sailed to the island of _Cuba_, where they landed, and
a camp was formed twenty miles up one of the large rivers of the
island. At this camp, the regiment was stationed some time; and the
country was reconnoitred in various directions by detachments. The
design of forming a British settlement on that part of the island
of Cuba, was, however, abandoned; in November the troops returned
on board ship, and were re-conveyed to Jamaica.

[Sidenote: 1742]

Having sustained a severe loss in killed and wounded at Carthagena,
and also from the effects of climate, the regiment returned to
England in 1742, and commenced recruiting its numbers.

[Sidenote: 1743]

[Sidenote: 1744]

During the years 1743 and 1744, the regiment was stationed in Great
Britain.

[Sidenote: 1745]

In the meantime, a British army was supporting the interest of the
house of Austria on the Continent; but the French monarch brought
so great a superiority of numbers into the field, that the allied
army, under His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, was unable
to prevent the enemy gaining possession of several fortified towns
in the Austrian Netherlands, during the summer of 1745. Under these
circumstances the regiment was sent from England to _Ostend_,
with the view of contributing to the preservation of that place,
where it arrived on the 27th of July. The French besieged Ostend,
which was defended by a garrison of British and Austrian troops
under Lieut.-General Count Chanclos, of the Austrian service, who
capitulated after a siege of thirteen days, the garrison being
permitted to march out with the honors of war, and proceed to the
Austrian territories. The FIFTEENTH joined the army.

At this period, Charles Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, had
aroused the Highland clans to arms, and asserted his father's
pretensions to the British throne. This rebellion occasioned the
regiment to be recalled from Flanders: it arrived in the river
Thames, and landed at Gravesend, on the 25th of October; but it was
not ordered to march against the insurgent clans--it was destined
to remain in the south of England, to oppose the threatened
invasion of the French.

[Sidenote: 1746]

When the hopes of the Pretender had been annihilated by the battle
of Culloden, on the 16th of April, 1746, part of the military
force of the kingdom became disposable for other services, and
the FIFTEENTH regiment was selected to form part of an expedition
against the French possessions in Canada. Various circumstances
occasioned the fleet to be detained so long, that this enterprise
was deferred, and an attempt on the port of _L'Orient_, the
principal station for the French East India Company's shipping and
stores, was resolved upon. The expedition sailed from Plymouth
on the 14th of September; on the 20th a landing was effected
on the coast of France, and the troops assembled to oppose the
debarkation were driven from the shore. On the following day, the
British advanced in two columns towards _L'Orient_; the FIFTEENTH
forming part of the second column. The French militia fired upon
the troops from the woods, and put the men of one or two corps
into some confusion, when Captain Honorable James Murray led the
grenadier company of the FIFTEENTH forward with great gallantry,
and dispersed the enemy. When the leading companies arrived at the
village of _Plemur_, they were fired upon from the houses; but this
resistance was speedily overcome, and the people were punished for
their temerity. On arriving before L'Orient, the governor proposed
to surrender; but the conditions demanded were not acceded to, in
consequence of a report of the engineers stating the practicability
of reducing the town. The siege was immediately commenced; but the
artillery and stores with the expedition proved unequal to the
undertaking, and the troops retreated to the coast, and re-embarked
without molestation.

Another descent was made on the French coast in October: the troops
landing on the peninsula of _Quiberon_, capturing a fort with
eighteen guns, and afterwards destroying the guns and forts in
the peninsula, with those in the isles of Houat and Hedic. These
services performed, the regiment returned on board the fleet and
sailed for England.

[Sidenote: 1748]

[Sidenote: 1749]

Negociations for a treaty of peace were commenced in 1748, at
Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1749, the strength of the army was reduced, and
the regiment proceeded to Ireland.

After commanding the regiment thirty-four years, Lieut.-General
Harrison died, in March of this year, and was succeeded by Colonel
John Jordan, from the lieut.-colonelcy of the tenth dragoons, by
commission, dated 15th of April, 1749.

[Sidenote: 1751]

In the clothing warrant, dated the 1st of July, 1751, the facing
of the regiment is directed to be yellow. The first, or King's
colour, to be the great union; the second, or regimental colour,
to be of yellow silk, with the union in the upper canton; in the
centre the number of the regiment in gold Roman characters, within
a wreath of roses and thistles on the same stalk. The uniform at
this period was cocked hats bound with white lace; scarlet coats
faced and turned up with yellow, and ornamented with white lace;
scarlet waistcoat and breeches; white gaiters; white cravats; and
buff belts.

[Sidenote: 1755]

The regiment remained in Ireland until the undetermined boundary
of the British and French settlements in North America occasioned
a rupture between the two kingdoms. The aggressions of the French
led to the sending of a body of British troops to North America
in 1755; at which period the establishment of the FIFTEENTH was
augmented, and the regiment embarked for England.

[Sidenote: 1756]

Colonel Jordan was removed to the ninth dragoons, in April, 1756,
and King George II. conferred the colonelcy of the FIFTEENTH foot
on Colonel Jeffery (afterwards Lord) Amherst, from captain and
lieut.-colonel in the first foot guards.

In July of this year the regiment pitched its tents near Blandford,
where an encampment was formed of six regiments of foot and two of
dragoons under Lieut.-General Sir Charles Howard.

[Sidenote: 1757]

Numerous encampments were formed also in the following year, and
the troops held in readiness to repel a threatened invasion of the
French. The FIFTEENTH foot, and four other corps, pitched their
tents on Barham-downs, under Charles Duke of Marlborough.

From Barham-downs the regiment proceeded to the Isle of Wight,
in order to form part of an expedition against the French naval
station of _Rochfort_, on the river Charente. The FIFTEENTH,
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Honorable Sir James Murray, was
formed in brigade with the fifth, twenty-fourth, thirtieth, and
fifty-first regiments; the land forces were under Lieut.-General
Sir John Mordaunt, and the navy under Admiral Sir Edward Hawke. The
fleet sailed in the early part of September; on the 23rd of that
month the _Isle of Aix_ was captured, and the forts were afterwards
destroyed. Owing to unfavourable weather, a landing could not be
effected near Rochfort before the enemy was alarmed and prepared
for a vigorous resistance. The troops were repeatedly in readiness
to land, and on one occasion the first division was in the boats;
but the weather, and other causes, prevented a debarkation taking
place. The expedition afterwards returned to England.

[Sidenote: 1758]

Early in the following year, the FIFTEENTH regiment, mustering
eight hundred and fifty officers and soldiers, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Honorable James Murray, embarked for North America,
to take part in the attack of the French possessions in that part
of the world. It proceeded to Halifax, in Nova Scotia, where the
expedition was prepared against _Louisburg_, the capital of the
island of Cape Breton,[11] in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, under the
orders of its colonel, Lieut.-General Sir Jeffery Amherst, K.B.,
the naval force being under Admiral Boscawen. The expedition
sailed from Halifax on the 28th of May, and approached Louisburg,
on the 2nd of June; but the weather was so unfavourable that a
landing could not be effected before the 8th of June. On that
occasion, the grenadier company of the FIFTEENTH formed part of
the centre division under the gallant Brigadier-General James
Wolfe, designed to force a landing; and the regiment formed
part of the left division, under Brigadier-General Lawrence,
designed to make a show of landing at Fresh-water Cove, to divert
the enemy's attention from the main attack. The division under
Brigadier-General Wolfe approached the shore under a heavy fire,
and the surf being high, several boats were overset. One boat,
containing part of the grenadier company of the FIFTEENTH, was
overset, when Lieutenant Kennedy, two serjeants, and thirteen rank
and file, were drowned. The regiment had also Lieutenant Nicholson
and eight men killed by the enemy's fire. The survivors, however,
jumped into the water with great gallantry, formed on the beach,
and being animated by their chivalrous leader, the heroic Wolfe,
they rushed upon their opponents with fixed bayonets, and carried
the enemy's works in a manner which excited great admiration. The
other divisions followed, and before night the army was on shore.

The siege of Louisburg was afterwards commenced; and the FIFTEENTH
regiment took part in this service. In carrying on the approaches,
and in making the attacks, the troops underwent great fatigues
with a cheerful alacrity, which redounded to their honor. The
enemy's sallies were repulsed: the fire of the British artillery
destroyed their shipping, silenced their batteries, and damaged
their works to so great an extent, that, on the 26th of July,
the garrison surrendered prisoners of war; the whole island was
also delivered up; and two other small islands in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence surrendered. Eleven stand of colours were captured on this
occasion, and sent to England.

Besides the officers and soldiers killed in effecting a landing,
the regiment had also Lieutenant Campbell killed; Lieutenant
Hamilton, Lieutenant and Adjutant Mukens, and Ensign Moneypenny,
wounded during the siege of Louisburg. The regiment had also a
considerable number of private soldiers killed and wounded.

The arrival of the news of this gallant exploit produced great
sensation in England; the captured colours were presented to the
King, and conducted by a splendid cavalcade from Kensington Palace
to St. Paul's Cathedral. The meritorious conduct of the officers
and soldiers of the expedition was rewarded with the approbation of
their Sovereign and the thanks of Parliament.

The FIFTEENTH were stationed at Louisburg during the remainder of
the year.

[Sidenote: 1759]

From Louisburg the regiment sailed in the beginning of June,
1759, with the expedition against _Quebec_, under Major-General
JAMES WOLFE; and was formed in brigade with the forty-third,
forty-eighth, and seventy-eighth foot, under Brigadier-General
Monckton. Towards the end of June, the army landed at Orleans,--a
large, fertile, and well-cultivated island in the river St.
Lawrence, below Quebec,--and commenced preparations for carrying on
the object of the expedition.

The French General, the Marquis of Montcalm, possessed a
superiority of numbers over the invading force, and he had made
excellent dispositions for the defence of the country: but the
English Commander had complete reliance on the valour of his
troops, whose confidence he possessed to an extraordinary degree.
The FIFTEENTH foot, and three other regiments, were detached
under Brigadier-General Monckton, against Point Levi, on the east
shore of the river, from whence a body of the enemy was driven;
at the same time a body of troops, under Colonel Carleton, took
possession of the western point of the island of Orleans, and
both these posts were fortified. Sixteen hundred of the enemy
attempted to retake Point Levi, but were repulsed; and a mortar
battery, constructed at that post, fired on Quebec, destroying the
lower town, and damaging the upper town. Having finished the works
on the island of Orleans, the army crossed the north channel of
the river in boats, and landed below the splendid waterfalls of
_Montmorenci_; and arrangements were made for attacking the enemy's
position beyond the river Montmorenci, in which the FIFTEENTH
regiment was ordered to co-operate.

As the regiment was crossing the river in boats from Point Levi,
the grenadiers effected a landing, and commenced the action
prematurely, before their formation was completed and before
the troops designed to sustain them had arrived; and they were
repulsed. They reformed behind the corps from Point Levi, the
FIFTEENTH and seventy-eighth; but the excess of ardour, without
sufficient attention to discipline, occasioned the loss of five
hundred officers and men, and the failure of the operation.[12]

Difficulties, calculated to perplex and discourage the most
resolute and intelligent commander, presented themselves; but
the English general evinced talent and perseverance. No prospect
of final success, by advancing across the river Montmorenci,
presenting itself, the troops re-embarked and proceeded to Point
Levi; they afterwards sailed a considerable distance up the river;
but it was found impossible to annoy the enemy above the town. A
desperate resolution was subsequently formed, to retire a little
down the river, land in the night within a league of Cape Diamond,
ascend the heights of Abraham, and gain possession of the ground at
the back of the city.

At midnight on the 12th of September, the troops went on board the
boats, and at one o'clock the first division moved down the river;
an officer who spoke the French language, answering the challenges
of the enemy's sentries on the shore. A landing was effected:
the officers and men climbed the steep woody precipice, pulling
themselves up by roots and branches of trees with admirable courage
and activity, dislodged a captain's guard, and gained the heights.
The FIFTEENTH and other corps followed.

When the French general was informed that the English had gained
the heights of Abraham, he instantly collected his forces and
advanced to give battle; and Major-General Wolfe, observing
the approach of the hostile troops, formed line, the FIFTEENTH
being posted in reserve. The enemy manifesting a design against
the British left, the FIFTEENTH were removed to that flank by
Brigadier-General Townshend, and were formed _en potence_,
presenting two fronts to the enemy.

About nine o'clock the action commenced, and was particularly
severe on the right, at which point the British regiments
behaved with extraordinary gallantry, charging with bayonets,
and overthrowing all opposition. In the midst of the action,
Major-General Wolfe was shot in the breast, and he expired at the
moment of victory. Brigadier-General Monckton was also wounded,
and the command devolved on Brigadier-General Townshend, who had
scarcely formed the troops after the pursuit, when a fresh body of
the enemy appeared in his rear: he detached two regiments against
them, and the enemy fled to the woods. The French commander, the
Marquis of Montcalm, was mortally wounded; and his second in
command, Brigadier-General de Senezergue, was wounded and taken
prisoner, and he died on board an English ship on the following day.

This victory was gained with the loss of about fifty men killed,
and five hundred wounded; but the fall of Major-General JAMES
WOLFE was a national loss. He possessed an animating fervour of
sentiment,--an intuitive perception,--extensive capacity,--personal
bravery beyond all estimation,--and an unbounded thirst for
glory; these bright qualities were combined with every species
of military knowledge that study could comprehend, and actual
service illustrate; and, while the sublimity of his genius soared
above ordinary minds, his generous disposition, and complacent
deportment, procured him universal esteem. The soldiers admired and
loved him.

After this victory, preparations were made for prosecuting the
siege of Quebec; but further loss of life was prevented by the
surrender of the garrison.

This conquest produced great joy in England; a day of thanksgiving
was set apart by proclamation; and the thanks of Parliament, with
the approbation of their Sovereign, were conveyed to the troops:
also an abundant supply of warm clothing, purchased by public
subscription, for the use of the men in the cold climate of Quebec.

The loss of the regiment in the several actions near Quebec, was
one surgeon's mate, two serjeants, and eleven rank and file killed;
Major Paulus Armil Irving, Captain Arthur Loftus, Lieutenants
Samuel Rutherford, John Maxwell, _senior_, John Maxwell, _junior_,
William Skeane, Robert Ross, James Leslie, Lieut. and Adjutant
Francis Mekins, Ensigns Edmund Wroth, Samuel Baker, nine serjeants,
one drummer, and ninety-seven rank and file, wounded.

The Lieut.-Colonel of the FIFTEENTH foot, Colonel Honorable James
Murray, was rewarded with the appointment of Colonel-commandant of
a battalion of the sixtieth regiment, and Governor of Quebec, in
which fortress the FIFTEENTH were stationed during the winter, and
they suffered severely from scurvy, occasioned by living constantly
on salt provisions.

[Sidenote: 1760]

Resolving, if possible, to regain possession of Quebec, a French
force, commanded by the Chevalier de Louis, advanced from Montreal
towards the end of April, 1760; the enemy attempted to cut off
the British out-posts, but was frustrated by the advance of the
piquets, the grenadiers, and the FIFTEENTH regiment.

Brigadier-General Murray led the garrison of Quebec forward to meet
the enemy, whom he engaged on the 28th of April, near the village
of _Sillery_, and gained some advantage; but the superior numbers
of the enemy rendered a retreat necessary, which was executed in
good order.

The enemy besieged _Quebec_, and the FIFTEENTH regiment had the
honour of taking part in a successful defence of that important
fortress. The governor stated in his despatch,--'I flatter myself
the extraordinary performances of the handful of brave men I
had left, will please His Majesty as much as they surprised us,
who were eye-witnesses of them.' While the garrison was making
a resolute defence, a British naval force arrived in the river,
destroyed the enemy's vessels near the town, and cannonaded their
lines. On the morning of the 17th of May, the FIFTEENTH were under
arms, to make a sally on the besieging force; but the French camp
was found empty, and the tents standing. A pursuit was ordered, and
some prisoners and baggage were captured.

In June a detachment of the regiment advanced up the river, in
vessels, to co-operate with the troops under General Sir Jeffery
Amherst, in an attack on the French army at _Montreal_. The British
advanced upon Montreal from three different points, and by a
well-arranged combination the whole were united before that place
in the early part of September. The French governor, the Marquis of
Vaudreuil, being unable to withstand the British arms, surrendered;
and the conquest of Canada was thus accomplished.

After this success, the regiment was assembled at Montreal, and it
was one of the corps which occupied that place for several months.

[Sidenote: 1761]

In the spring of 1761, the regiment proceeded up Lake Champlain in
boats, marched from the shore of the lake to Albany, and afterwards
sailed down the Hudson river to New York. In June it was encamped
on Staten Island, and in October sailed for Barbadoes, where an
expedition was assembled under Major-General Monckton, for an
attack on the French island of _Martinique_, and the FIFTEENTH was
one of the corps selected for this service.

[Sidenote: 1762]

The expedition sailed from Carlisle-bay on the 5th of January,
1762, and a landing was effected on the island of Martinique in
the middle of that month. The FIFTEENTH were actively employed in
the operations necessary to bring the enemy to submission, and
some severe fighting took place, in which the regiment had several
men killed and wounded; Captain Prescott and Lieutenant Leslie,
being among the latter. The governor, M. Le Vassor de la Touche,
surrendered the island in February.

War having been declared against Spain, the regiment was attached
to the armament under General the Earl of Albemarle, destined to
attack the valuable settlement of the _Havannah_, on the island of
Cuba. Passing through the straits of Bahama, the expedition arrived
within six leagues of the Havannah on the 6th of June; a landing
was effected on the following day; and on the 9th, the troops took
up a position between Coximar and the _Moro_, a fort which it was
deemed necessary to besiege and capture before an attack was made
on the town. In this service, great hardships had to be endured;
a thin soil, hardly sufficient to cover the troops in their
approaches, a scarcity of water, and the labour of dragging the
artillery several miles over a rocky country, and under a burning
sun, called forth the efforts of the army and navy. The works
were carried on, the sallies of the enemy were repulsed, and the
Moro fort was captured by storm on the 30th of July. A series of
batteries were erected against the town; and on the 11th of August
they opened so well-directed a fire, that the guns of the garrison
were silenced, and flags of truce were hung out from the town, and
ships in the harbour. The terms of capitulation were agreed upon,
and the British took possession of this valuable settlement, with
nine men of war in the harbour, and two upon the stocks.

The regiment lost a number of men on this important service;
Lieutenant Skene was among the killed; Captain Tyrwhitt and
Lieutenant Winter died from the effects of climate.

After the capture of the Havannah, the regiment was stationed at
that place eleven months.

[Sidenote: 1763]

In the meantime a treaty of peace had been concluded, and in 1763
the Havannah was restored to Spain; the regiment was relieved by
the Spanish troops which arrived to take possession of the colony,
and embarked for New York, from whence it proceeded, by Albany and
Lake Champlain, to Canada, where it was stationed several years.

[Sidenote: 1764]

[Sidenote: 1765]

[Sidenote: 1768]

After occupying quarters successively at Montreal, Quebec, and on
the upper lakes, until the summer of 1768, the regiment embarked
for England, and landed at Portsmouth in July.

Occurrences of a political character having induced Sir Jeffery
Amherst to resign the colonelcy of the regiment, he was succeeded,
on the 21st of September, 1768, by Colonel Charles Hotham
(afterwards Sir Charles Thompson, Baronet) from the sixty-third
regiment.

[Sidenote: 1769]

[Sidenote: 1770]

[Sidenote: 1771]

The regiment occupied various quarters in the southern and midland
counties of England, until the summer of 1770, when it was reviewed
at Chatham by King George III. and in the spring of 1771 marched
into Yorkshire.

[Sidenote: 1772]

[Sidenote: 1773]

[Sidenote: 1774]

In 1772 the regiment marched to Scotland, where it was stationed
during the following year, and in the spring of 1774 it embarked at
Port Patrick for Ireland.

[Sidenote: 1775]

Major-General Sir Charles Thompson was succeeded in the colonelcy
of the regiment, in September, 1775, by Major-General Richard Earl
of Cavan, from the fifty-fifth regiment of foot.

[Sidenote: 1776]

In the meantime, the determined spirit evinced by the British
colonists in North America to resist the acts of parliament passed
in England for raising a revenue in their country, had been
followed by hostilities, and the FIFTEENTH regiment was one of
the corps selected to proceed across the Atlantic, to aid in the
attempt to reduce the refractory provincials to submission. The
regiment embarked from Ireland early in 1776, and proceeded to Cape
Fear, in North Carolina, with four other corps, under Major-General
the Earl Cornwallis. These troops arrived on the coast of North
Carolina early in April, and Lieut.-General Clinton assumed the
command. The men landed at Cape Fear to refresh themselves after
the voyage, and returning on board the transports, sailed, on
the 1st of June, with the expedition against _Charleston_. After
passing Charleston bar, the troops landed on one of the islands,
but the armament proved of insufficient strength for the capture of
the capital of South Carolina, and the five regiments re-embarked
and proceeded to Staten Island, where the main body of the British
forces was assembled under General Sir William Howe. The FIFTEENTH,
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel John Bird, were formed in brigade
with the fourth, twenty-seventh, and forty-fifth regiments, under
Major-General Pigot.

A landing was effected on _Long Island_ on the 22nd of August,
and the FIFTEENTH regiment formed part of the force under
Lieut.-General Clinton, which advanced after dusk on the evening of
the 26th to seize on a pass in the heights, and turn the enemy's
left flank at Flat-bush. This pass was taken possession of on the
following morning; the army advanced, and the Americans were driven
from their position with considerable loss, and forced to retreat
to their fortified lines at _Brooklyn_. The loss of the regiment on
this occasion was limited to a few men wounded.

The Americans quitted their fortified lines during the night of the
28th of August, and retired across the East River, in boats, to New
York; and the reduction of Long Island was thus accomplished in a
few days, with little loss.

From Long Island the regiment proceeded with the army across the
East River, when General Washington was forced to abandon New York,
which city was taken possession of by the British.

Proceeding up the river, the regiment took part in the operations
of the army by which the Americans were forced to evacuate their
lines on _White Plains_; but it did not sustain any loss.

The regiment took part in the attack and capture of the enemy's
lines and redoubts near _Fort Washington_, on the 16th of November,
when it had a few private soldiers killed and wounded.

After taking part in these services, the regiment proceeded into
winter quarters at the city of New York.

[Sidenote: 1777]

Information being received that the Americans were forming
magazines at _Peek's-hill_, about fifty miles up the North River,
Lieut.-Colonel Bird, of the FIFTEENTH, was detached from New York
against that post, with a body of troops, of which a division
of the regiment formed part. The troops sailed from New York on
the 22nd of March, 1777, and as they approached Peek's-hill, the
Americans set fire to the stores and retreated. The British landed,
completed the destruction of the magazines, barracks, &c., and
afterwards returned to New York.

Extensive depôts were also prepared by the Americans at _Danbury_,
and other places on the borders of Connecticut, and the FIFTEENTH
regiment formed part of a body of troops which embarked from New
York, under Major-General Tyron, for the destruction of these
magazines. The British arrived off Norwalk on the evening of the
25th of April, landed without opposition, and commenced their march
for Danbury, from whence the American troops fled, as the English
approached that place on the afternoon of the following day. As no
carriages could be procured to bring off any part of the immense
collection of stores at this place, the magazines were set on fire,
and in the progress of the flames the town was unavoidably burnt.
This service accomplished, the British commenced their march back
to the coast, early on the morning of the 27th of April, when a
body of Americans hung upon their rear, and at every eminence a
corps of militia was found ready to oppose their march; but they
attacked and routed their opponents; and in one of the skirmishes
the American General Wooster was killed.

Arriving at _Ridgefield_, the British were opposed by a strong
force under General Arnold, protected by intrenchments, which
the Americans were preparing; but a few rounds from the English
artillery, and a gallant charge with bayonets, routed the American
force, and the King's troops halted at Ridgefield during the night.

Resuming the march on the following morning, the British were
harassed by the enemy, in their retrograde movement, and numerous
skirmishes occurred. Arriving at the _Hill of Compo_, contiguous
to the place of embarkation, the Americans appeared in force, and
commenced an attack with greater spirit and determination than
before; the British troops confronted their numerous assailants,
fired a volley, and charged with bayonets with so much impetuosity
and valour, that the Americans were unable to withstand the shock,
and they retreated. The King's troops afterwards embarked without
molestation for New York.

Eight rank and file of the FIFTEENTH regiment were killed on this
expedition; Captain Harry Ditmas, one serjeant, and fifteen rank
and file wounded; two men missing. Lieutenant Charles Hastings, of
the twelfth foot, serving as a volunteer with the regiment, was
also wounded.

Afterwards taking the field with the army in the Jerseys, the
regiment was engaged in the operations designed to bring the enemy
to a general engagement, but the Americans kept close in their
fortified lines in the mountains; and an expedition against the
populous and wealthy city of Philadelphia was resolved upon. The
FIFTEENTH, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel John Bird, were employed in
this enterprise, and were formed in brigade with the seventeenth,
forty-second, and forty-fourth regiments, under Major-General
(afterwards Earl) Grey.

Embarking from Sandy Hook, the army sailed to the Chesapeake, and
proceeding up Elk River, landed on the northern shore on the 25th
of August. The American army took up a position at _Brandywine_ to
oppose the advance, and on the 11th of September the royal forces
moved forward to engage their opponents. The FIFTEENTH formed part
of the column under Major-General the Earl Cornwallis, which made
a circuit of some miles to turn the right and gain the rear of the
American army. The action proved decisive; the enemy was driven
from his position, and forced to make a precipitate retreat. The
battalion companies of the regiment did not sustain any loss on
this occasion; but the flank companies, being formed in grenadier
and light infantry battalions, had Lieutenant Faulkener killed;
Captain Cathcart, Captain Douglas, and Lieutenant Leigh wounded;
also several men killed and wounded.

After this victory, the army continued its advance; Philadelphia
was taken possession of, and the British troops took up a position
at Germantown, the FIFTEENTH being posted on the left of the
village.

Making a forced march during the night of the 3rd of October, the
American army appeared suddenly in front of _Germantown_ before
daylight on the following morning, and attacked the British
outposts, thinking to surprise the troops in an unprepared state.
The first assault was opposed by the second battalion of light
infantry, and the fortieth regiment, under Lieut.-Colonel Musgrave,
posted at the head of the village; these corps were forced to fall
back, and Lieut.-Colonel Musgrave threw himself, with six companies
of the fortieth, into a large store-house, where he was attacked
by an American brigade, aided by four pieces of cannon. During the
contest, while the soldiers of the fortieth were defending their
post manfully, Major-General Grey brought forward the FIFTEENTH,
and two other corps; and making a determined attack on the American
regiments, drove them back with great slaughter. The enemy was
also repulsed at every part of the field, and forced to make a
precipitate retreat.

Lieut.-Colonel John Bird, Ensign Anthony Frederick, and five rank
and file of the regiment were killed; Captains George Goldfrap and
Harry Ditmas, Lieutenant George Thomas, Ensign Henry Ball, two
serjeants, and forty-two rank and file wounded. In alluding to the
death of Lieut.-Colonel Bird, General Sir William Howe spoke of it
as an event 'much to be lamented, he being an officer of experience
and approved merit.' General Washington formed a fortified camp at
_Whitemarsh_; and early in December the British army advanced with
the view of inducing the Americans to quit their lines and offer
battle, or of finding a vulnerable part in their fortified camp.
Several skirmishes occurred, in which the British troops evinced
their native intrepidity and firmness, and were victorious in every
instance; but the defences of the American camp were found too
strong to be attacked, and the army marched into winter quarters at
Philadelphia.

[Sidenote: 1778]

After passing the winter at the capital of Pennsylvania, the
regiment furnished several parties, in the spring of 1778, to range
the country, and open communications for bringing in supplies.

The regiment also shared in the fatigues and difficulties of
the march of the army from Philadelphia to New York, under
Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton, rendered necessary by the French
monarch having united with the revolted British provinces, and thus
changed the character of the war. As the army pursued its journey,
crossing rivers, and traversing a wild and woody country, the
enemy menaced the flanks and rear with an attack in force; and on
the 28th of June, some sharp fighting took place, near _Freehold_
in New Jersey, when the grenadier company of the FIFTEENTH
distinguished itself, and the enemy was repulsed. Captain Cathcart,
of the regiment, was wounded; and also Captain Ditmas, who was
attached to the second grenadier battalion.

The army afterwards continued its route, and arrived at New York in
July.

A powerful French armament menacing the British possessions in
the West Indies, the FIFTEENTH, and several other corps, sailed
from North America, early in November, for Barbadoes, under
Major-General Grant.

While the regiment was at sea, its colonel, Major-General the
Earl of Cavan, died at Dublin, and was succeeded by Major-General
William Fawcett, deputy adjutant-general to the forces.

On the arrival of the reinforcements at Barbadoes, the British
naval and military commanders resolved to act offensively, and
attack the French island of _St. Lucia_. On this occasion the
regiment was formed in brigade with the twenty-eighth, forty-sixth,
and fifty-fifth, under Major-General Prescott. The expedition
sailed from Carlisle-bay on the 12th of December, a landing was
effected at St. Lucia on the following day, and on the 14th, the
French troops were driven from several important posts. In the
meantime a French armament of very superior numbers approached the
island, and the British took up positions to repel the enemy. The
French fleet made a desperate attack on the British naval force,
but was repulsed. A numerous body of the enemy landed, and stormed
the post of La Vigie, which was occupied by the grenadiers, light
infantry, and fifth regiment, under Brigadier-General Medows;
when the determined bravery of the British proved triumphant
over very superior numbers, and the French were repulsed and
forced to re-embark, leaving the ground covered with killed and
wounded. The flank companies of the FIFTEENTH had an opportunity
of distinguishing themselves on this occasion. The governor
surrendered the island to the British arms immediately after the
departure of the French armament.

[Sidenote: 1779]

[Sidenote: 1780]

The FIFTEENTH remained at St. Lucia several months. In the
meantime, the French possessed a great superiority of numbers,
both of naval and land force, in the West Indies; and in June,
1779, they attacked the island of _St. Vincent_, and in July
_Grenada_; the regiment embarked from St. Lucia, for the relief of
these islands; but they were captured before any force could arrive
to their assistance. While the regiment was at sea, some sharp
fighting occurred between the hostile fleets, without decisive
results, and the regiment was afterwards landed at the island of
St. Christopher's, where it was stationed during the year 1780.

[Sidenote: 1781]

Holland having adopted a line of politics hostile to the British,
and favourable to the American interest, war took place between
Great Britain and the United Provinces; and in February, 1781,
the Dutch island of _St. Eustatius_ was captured. The FIFTEENTH
regiment was afterwards removed from St. Christopher's to St.
Eustatius, and the flank companies were subsequently detached to
the former island.

The British commandant at St. Eustatius neglected to adopt the
necessary precautions for the security of the island, and during
the night of the 26th of November, a French force, under the
Marquis of Bouillé, effected a landing, captured the commandant
as he was taking a morning ride, overpowered the posts, and
forced the garrison, consisting of the battalion companies of the
thirteenth and FIFTEENTH regiments, to surrender prisoners of war.
The commandant, Lieut.-Colonel Cockburn, was afterwards tried by a
general court-martial, and cashiered.

After being detained a short period, the regiment was exchanged,
and resumed its duties.

[Sidenote: 1782]

The flank companies were stationed at _St. Christopher's_, with
the first battalion of the royals and a detachment of artillery,
which constituted the military force of the island, under
Brigadier-General Fraser, when a powerful French armament appeared
off that place in the beginning of January, 1782. Eight thousand
French troops landed, with a powerful train of artillery, under
the Marquis of Bouillé; and the English troops, being unable to
oppose so numerous a host on open ground, took possession of
_Brimstone-hill_, a formidable post, but the fortifications were
old and in a ruinous state, and the soldiers had no intrenching
tools; a desperate defence was however determined on, in hopes of
being relieved.

Against this post the French batteries opened their fire, on the
19th of January, and from that day a storm of balls and bombs
rattled round the hill with increasing fury, until the houses on
the heights were battered to pieces, and the old works were nearly
destroyed. During this period a British naval force approached
the island, and a body of troops landed; but the enemy had so
great a superiority of numbers, that no reasonable expectation
could be entertained of being able to save the island, and the
troops returned on board the fleet. In the meantime, the works
on Brimstone-hill had been breached in several places, and the
garrison was reduced to the last extremity; yet the troops
continued to evince that valour and firmness for which British
soldiers have been distinguished; and their conduct excited the
admiration of their enemies. When all prospect of being able to
resist many hours longer was gone, the garrison capitulated, and
was permitted to march through the breach with the honours of
war, and return to England, on condition of being considered as
prisoners of war until exchanged. The conduct of the officers
and soldiers who defended Brimstone-hill was highly commended in
Brigadier-General Fraser's despatch; and has been held up as an
example of British courage and resolution, by historians.

The regiment returned to England, and many of the officers and men,
who had been made prisoners, were lost on the voyage, in the _Ville
de Paris_, a French ship, which had been captured by Admiral Rodney.

This year the FIFTEENTH received the title of the EAST RIDING
YORKSHIRE regiment, and was directed to cultivate a connexion with
that part of the county, to facilitate the procuring of recruits.

[Sidenote: 1783]

[Sidenote: 1784]

[Sidenote: 1785]

During the year 1783, the regiment was stationed in Yorkshire, and
rapidly increased in numbers; in the following year it proceeded to
Ireland, and was employed on Dublin duty in 1785.

[Sidenote: 1790]

[Sidenote: 1791]

After remaining in Ireland six years, the regiment embarked at
Cork, in the summer of 1790, mustering seven hundred men, and
proceeded to Barbadoes. In 1791, its establishment was reduced, and
upwards of two hundred men were transferred to other corps.

[Sidenote: 1792]

Lieut.-General Fawcett was removed to the third dragoon guards,
in August, 1792; and King George III. conferred the colonelcy
of the FIFTEENTH foot on Major-General James Hamilton, from the
lieut.-colonelcy of the twenty-first, or royal North British
fusiliers.

[Sidenote: 1793]

In 1793 the regiment was removed from Barbadoes to Dominica, where
it was stationed several months.

[Sidenote: 1794]

Resistance to the authority of the crown, in France, had, in the
meantime, led to a violent and sanguinary revolution, and the
French West India Islands had become the scene of democratic
outrage. Great Britain engaged in war to arrest the progress
of anarchy; and the FIFTEENTH regiment was selected to join an
expedition under General Sir Charles Grey, prepared to rescue the
French West India Islands from republican outrage.

The expedition sailed from Carlisle-bay, Barbadoes, early in
February, 1794; landed at three different points on the island of
_Martinique_, on the 5th, 6th, and 8th of that month, and drove the
enemy from numerous strong posts. Two companies of the FIFTEENTH
distinguished themselves in storming Mount Mathurine, where a
battery was erected, which compelled the garrison of Pigeon Island
to surrender at discretion. 'The FIFTEENTH regiment, led by Major
Lyon and commanded by Captain Panmier, surprised several hundreds
of the enemy, very strongly posted, on the heights of Le Grand
Bouclain, on the 12th of February, killing several and taking all
their arms, ammunition, cattle, &c.'[13] The enemy's out-posts
being driven in, Fort Royal and Fort Bourbon were besieged;
the former was captured on the 20th of March, and the latter
surrendered two days afterwards. The loss of the regiment on this
service was limited to a few soldiers killed and wounded.

The regiment remained at Martinique, while a detachment proceeded
to St. Lucia, and captured that island.

From Martinique the expedition proceeded against _Guadaloupe_.
A determined resistance was experienced at this place, but the
island was captured before the end of April; and Sir Charles Grey
stated in his despatch, that he 'could not find words to convey an
adequate idea, or to express the high sense he entertained of the
extraordinary merit evinced by the officers and soldiers in this
service.' The regiment had Captain Comb and Ensign Croker killed,
and several private soldiers killed and wounded.

[Sidenote: 1795]

The regiment remained a short time at Martinique, and afterwards
proceeded to Dominica; but returned to Martinique in January,
1795, and was stationed at that island twelve months, under
Lieut.-Colonel Madden.

[Sidenote: 1796]

In 1796 the regiment transferred two hundred and fifty men to the
forty-fifth foot, and embarked for England, its numbers being
reduced to fifty-three men. It landed in November at Portsmouth,
marched to Derby, and active measures were adopted to recruit its
ranks to the augmented establishment of a thousand men.

[Sidenote: 1797]

[Sidenote: 1798]

[Sidenote: 1799]

Marching northward from Derby, in April, 1797, the regiment
proceeded across the border, and was stationed two years in
Scotland. It afterwards returned to England, and was quartered at
Sunderland barracks.

The militia regiments being permitted to volunteer into the regular
army, fifteen hundred and thirty-eight men volunteered to the
FIFTEENTH, and the regiment was augmented to _two battalions_.

[Sidenote: 1800]

Both battalions proceeded to Ireland in 1800, the first under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Madden, and the second under Major Lord
Sinclair; Lieut.-Colonel Barry afterwards succeeded to the command
of the first battalion.

[Sidenote: 1802]

In 1802, the war was terminated by the treaty of Amiens; when
the British army was reduced, and the second battalion was
disbanded,--the establishment of the regiment being fixed at seven
hundred and fifty rank and file.

[Sidenote: 1803]

The conduct of Napoleon Buonaparte, then First Consul of France,
occasioned hostilities to be resumed in 1803, when the British army
was augmented, and preparations made to repel a threatened invasion
of the French. The FIFTEENTH regiment remained in Ireland.

[Sidenote: 1804]

Preparations to repel the menaced French invasion were continued
in 1804, and a _second battalion_ was added to the regiment. It
was formed of men raised for limited service under the Additional
Force Act passed on the 29th of June, 1804, and was quartered at
Scarborough, in Yorkshire.

[Sidenote: 1805]

During the winter, the first battalion again embarked for the West
Indies, and landed at Barbadoes on the 12th of March, 1805. In May,
Surgeon Shaw died at Barbadoes.

This year is celebrated in the naval annals of Great Britain for
the splendid achievements of the marine forces of the kingdom.
Rear-Admiral Viscount Nelson having proceeded to the West Indies in
quest of the French fleet, the FIFTEENTH regiment received orders
to embark and serve as marines. It went on board on the 4th of
June, Lieut.-Colonel Barry and the staff being appointed to the
"Conqueror" of seventy-four guns; but after a cruise of fourteen
days, the fleet returned to port, and the regiment landed: it
therefore missed sharing in the glorious victory of Trafalgar, on
the 21st of October, 1805. During the months of July, August, and
September, the regiment lost nine officers and two hundred and
twelve men by fever.

[Sidenote: 1806]

In May, 1806, a draft of one hundred and twenty-four men joined
from the second battalion, and a few volunteers from the eleventh
regiment.

[Sidenote: 1807]

On the 24th of January, 1807, the regiment was suddenly embarked on
board the fleet; but after a short cruise returned to Barbadoes,
from whence it was removed to Grenada in April.

The court of Denmark having united with France, in hostilities
against Great Britain, an expedition was prepared against the
Danish islands of _St. Thomas_ and _Santa Croix_, and the FIFTEENTH
embarked from Grenada to take part in this service. These colonies
surrendered on being summoned, and loss of life was thus prevented.

[Sidenote: 1808]

In July, 1808, a draft of six serjeants and two hundred and
ninety-three rank and file joined from the second battalion.

In November and the early part of December, the regiment lost about
one hundred and fifty men from the effects of the climate of the
West Indies.

[Sidenote: 1809]

The regiment joined the expedition under Lieut.-General Beckwith,
which sailed from Carlisle-bay, Barbadoes, on the 28th of January,
1809, against the island of _Martinique_. The first division landed
in Bay Robert, and the second near St. Luce and Point Solomon.
The enemy's force was numerous, and some sharp fighting occurred,
in which the regiment had the honor to distinguish itself, and
had several men killed and wounded. The conquest of the island
was achieved in a few weeks, and Lieut.-General Beckwith stated
in his public despatch,--'The having commanded such an army will
constitute the pride of my future life. To these brave troops,
conducted by Generals of experience, their king and country owe
the sovereignty of this important colony; and I trust, that by a
comparison of the force which defended it, and the time in which it
has fallen, the present reduction of Martinique will not be deemed
eclipsed by any former expedition.'

The royal authority was afterwards given for the regiment to
bear the word "MARTINIQUE" on its colours, to commemorate its
distinguished gallantry on this occasion. Lieut.-Colonel Riall
received a medal for commanding a brigade, and Major Andrew
Davidson for commanding the regiment.

Three French sail of the line and two frigates, from L'Orient,
having taken shelter in the _Saints_, in the vicinity of
Guadaloupe, they were blockaded by Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander
Cochrane; and three thousand men, of which force the FIFTEENTH
formed part, were detached, under Major-General Maitland, for
the reduction of the islands. This expedition sailed from Port
Royal on the 12th of April; a landing was effected in Ance Bois
Joly, and the difficult heights of Mount Russel, eight hundred
feet high, were stormed and captured, and a battery soon forced
the French shipping to put to sea. The reduction of the islands
was accomplished in a few days, and the enemy's garrison was
made prisoners of war. During the action on the 15th of April,
Lieut.-Colonel Phineas Riall volunteered to storm Fort Morelli,
with the FIFTEENTH regiment; but Major-General Maitland would not
allow the corps to engage in so dangerous an enterprise.

Towards the end of April, the regiment returned to Grenada, where
it was stationed about nine months.

[Sidenote: 1810]

Three hundred men of the regiment, including the flank companies,
embarked from Grenada, early in January, 1810, under Lieut.-Colonel
Riall, for Barbadoes, to join the expedition against _Guadaloupe_,
under Lieut.-General Sir George Beckwith, and were formed in
brigade with a battalion of light infantry, and the third West
India regiment, under Brigadier-General Harcourt; this officer
being afterwards appointed to the command of a division, the
brigade was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Riall, of the FIFTEENTH.

The expedition rendezvoused at Prince Rupert's, Dominica, and the
FIFTEENTH accompanied the second division, which sailed on the
26th of January, and anchored at the Saints until the 29th, when
it proceeded towards Guadaloupe, and menaced the enemy's defences
at the Three Rivers. During the night the regiment landed in the
bay near the village of Les Vieux Habitans without opposition, and
afterwards advanced, the enemy's posts falling back skirmishing.
The French appearing in force on some high open ground, the
FIFTEENTH turned their right flank, the Royal West India Rangers
the left, and the thirteenth light infantry advanced against the
front, when the enemy was speedily forced from his ground.

The regiment afterwards took part in completing the conquest of
the island, an achievement which reflected credit on the troops
employed in the enterprise. The conduct of Lieut.-Colonel Riall was
commended in the public despatch of the Commander of the Forces.

The following statement appeared in general orders, dated 6th
February:--'The Commander of the Forces returns his thanks to the
officers of all ranks, for their meritorious exertions, and to the
non-commissioned officers and soldiers, for the cheerfulness with
which they have undergone the fatigues of a march, difficult in its
nature, through the strongest country in the world, and the spirit
they have manifested on all occasions to close with the enemy.'

The loss of the regiment was limited to a few private soldiers
killed and wounded, and Captain William Grierson wounded.

To commemorate the distinguished gallantry of the regiment on this
occasion, the royal authority was afterwards given for the word
"GUADALOUPE" to be displayed on its colours. Lieut.-Colonel Riall
received a medal for commanding a brigade.

In March, that portion of the regiment which had been left at
Grenada, joined at Guadaloupe; also a draft of ninety men from the
second battalion. Another draft of one hundred men joined from the
second battalion in July, under Lieut.-Colonel Barry, who assumed
the command of the regiment,--Lieut.-Colonel Riall proceeding to
Europe on leave of absence.

The health of the men soon afterwards suffered severely from
the effects of the climate of Guadaloupe, and two hundred and
seventy-six non-commissioned officers and soldiers died. The
survivors were moved to the Champ de Mars, and afterwards occupied
the convalescent posts of Matuba, Dolce, Vermont, and Vieux Fort.

[Sidenote: 1811]

[Sidenote: 1812]

The regiment remained at Guadaloupe during the year 1811; in
May, 1812, it was removed to St. Christopher's and stationed on
Brimstone-hill, under Lieut.-Colonel Davidson.

On the 21st of September, Lieut.-Colonel Renny joined with a
detachment of two serjeants, and one hundred and forty-six rank and
file, from the second battalion.

[Sidenote: 1813]

Several detachments also joined from the second battalion in 1813.

[Sidenote: 1814]

After commanding the regiment twenty years, General Powell died
in the summer of 1814, and was succeeded in the colonelcy by
Lieut.-General Moore Disney, from major in the first foot guards.

The victories of the British troops, in the Peninsula and the
south of France, having accomplished the reduction of the power of
Napoleon Buonaparte, and the restoration of the house of Bourbon to
the throne of France, a general peace was proclaimed, the army was
reduced, and the second battalion of the FIFTEENTH was disbanded
in October, 1814, on the island of Jersey, whither it had proceeded
in June, 1811: its services had been limited to Great Britain and
Jersey.

[Sidenote: 1815]

Early in 1815, the men of the late second battalion embarked
to join the regiment at the island of St. Christopher; but the
transports encountered much severe weather, and were forced
into Falmouth harbour, and the soldiers landed. At this period,
Buonaparte had violated the treaty of 1814, and regained the
throne of France. War immediately followed; and His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent directed the second battalion of the FIFTEENTH
regiment to be re-formed; this took place accordingly, and the men
who had landed at Falmouth proceeded to Guernsey, where they were
joined by the depôt.

The French troops on the islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe
evinced a disposition to renounce their allegiance to Louis
XVIII., and proclaim Buonaparte, and the former island was taken
possession of by British troops in June; at _Guadaloupe_, the
Emperor Napoleon was proclaimed on the 18th of June, a day fatal
to his power on the field of Waterloo; and the first battalion of
the FIFTEENTH regiment proceeded from St. Christopher to Barbadoes,
from whence it sailed with the expedition against Guadaloupe, under
Lieut.-General Sir James Leith. A landing was effected on the
island on the 8th of August, and the French troops were speedily
forced to surrender prisoners of war.

The regiment proceeded to the Champ de Mars, where it was stationed
until the end of September, when it embarked for Barbadoes.

[Sidenote: 1816]

Peace having been restored, and Buonaparte sent in exile to St.
Helena, the second battalion of the regiment was disbanded in the
island of Guernsey, on the 25th of January, 1816; the men fit for
service embarking to join the first battalion at Barbadoes.

On the 15th of April, the regiment marched from garrison at St.
Anne's, to quell an insurrection among the negroes in the interior
of the island of Barbadoes, where strong detachments remained until
June, when the regiment was removed to Martinique.

In August, the French eighty-eighth regiment, or Martinique Legion,
arrived to garrison the island, and the FIFTEENTH, being relieved,
proceeded to Grenada, where they landed on the 5th of September,
and marched into garrison at Richmond-hill.

[Sidenote: 1817]

[Sidenote: 1818]

From Grenada the regiment embarked, in the spring of 1817, in two
divisions, under Lieut.-Colonel Davidson and Major Maxwell, for
Halifax in Nova Scotia, where it was stationed two years.

[Sidenote: 1819]

The right wing, under Major Maxwell, embarked for Bermuda in June,
1819, and relieved the left wing of the sixty-second regiment at
Fort George barracks, where the FIFTEENTH lost between sixty and
seventy men of the yellow fever, in August and September.

[Sidenote: 1820]

[Sidenote: 1821]

During the year 1820, the regiment was stationed at Bermuda and
Nova Scotia. In the summer of 1821, it was relieved at the former
station by a wing of the second battalion of the sixtieth, and at
the latter by the eighty-first regiment; and embarking for England,
landed at Portsmouth in July and August, and was stationed at Fort
Cumberland until November, when it embarked for Plymouth.

[Sidenote: 1822]

In the summer of 1822, the regiment was removed to Hull; in October
it embarked at Liverpool for Ireland, and landing at Dublin,
occupied Richmond barracks a few weeks, and afterwards proceeded to
Naas.

[Sidenote: 1823]

[Sidenote: 1824]

The regiment was removed in the summer of 1823 to Waterford, and
in the autumn to Cork, with a detachment at Spike Island; and it
occupied this station during the year 1824.

[Sidenote: 1825]

Leaving Cork in July, 1825, the regiment proceeded to Buttevant,
with detachments to the towns in the neighbourhood.

[Sidenote: 1826]

A division of the regiment marched to Templemore in February, 1826,
and sent out numerous detachments. One party stationed at Thurles,
under Captain Temple, evinced great patience and forbearance,
united with a proper degree of firmness, in suppressing a riot at
that place, when several persons had been killed by the police.
Captain Temple received an address of thanks and approbation from
the magistrates and principal inhabitants of the town, for his cool
and judicious conduct on this occasion. In the autumn the regiment
marched to Galway, sending out eleven detachments.

[Sidenote: 1827]

In April, 1827, the regiment was divided into six _service_ and
four _reserve_ companies, and marched to Fermoy, where it was
inspected by Major-General Sir George Bingham, who expressed his
unqualified approbation of its appearance, discipline, and interior
economy. In May, the service companies embarked from the Cove of
Cork, under Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh, for Canada, and arrived
at Quebec on the 29th of June and 6th of July; they immediately
proceeded up the river St. Lawrence, to Kingston in Upper Canada,
where they remained ten months.

[Sidenote: 1828]

Retiring down the River St. Lawrence, in boats, in May and June,
1828, the service companies proceeded to Montreal, from whence
the first division continued its journey, in a steam vessel, to
Quebec, and was followed by the second division in August.

[Sidenote: 1830]

The regiment was stationed at Quebec during the years 1829 and
1830; in October of the latter year, a strong detachment proceeded
to the Isle aux Noix, on Lake Champlain.

The regiment continued in garrison at Quebec, detaching 100 rank
and file to the Isle aux Noix and St. John's, with a proportion of
officers and non-commissioned officers.

[Sidenote: 1831]

The regiment moved to Montreal on the 3rd of May of this year,
continuing its detachments.

[Sidenote: 1832]

On the 21st of May, 1832, Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh, commanding the
regiment, and Commandant of the Garrison of Montreal, was called
upon by the magistrates of that place to be prepared to assist
the civil power in the event of a riot occurring at a contested
election for the west ward of the city, which was to terminate
on that day. Captain Temple was the captain of the piquet on the
occasion, but when it was turned out, Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh took
command of it in person. At the close of the poll, several acts
of violence were perpetrated both on persons and property, when
it became necessary to require the co-operation of the piquet in
restoring order. The Riot Act having been read, the Lieut.-Colonel
was authorised by the Magistrates to take such steps as might
appear to him necessary. The piquet was immediately marched in the
direction of the rioters, who assailed the party with stones and
other missiles, when the order to "fire" was given, not, however,
until every effort had been exerted to cause them to disperse. The
front rank alone, consisting of about sixteen men, discharged their
pieces in quick succession, the consequences of which proved fatal
on the spot to three of the rioters; several others were severely
wounded, but the disturbance was effectually checked. The regiment
remained under arms in different parts of the town during the night.

A company of the Royal Artillery stationed at the Island of St.
Helen's, under the command of Captain W. C. Anderson, brought over
two nine-pounders in the short space of twelve minutes from the
time the signal was given for their services, and remained on duty
with the regiment until the next day. This was remarkable, as the
river is nearly a mile broad, with a very rapid current, and the
guns had to be shipped in bateaux after the signal was made, and
re-limbered on landing at the Montreal side.

The conduct of the troops, particularly that portion under the
immediate orders of Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh, was marked by great
steadiness and forbearance, notwithstanding that they had been
harassed by continual alarms for some days previous to the riot. On
the day of the 21st the rain fell in torrents, whilst the men were
exposed to it for hours before the riot commenced.

The following documents are deemed worthy of a place in these
Records; the conduct and discipline of the corps, on the occasion
referred to, being highly estimated by the civil and military
authorities.

  _Presentment of Grand Jury._

  'The grand jury humbly represent to the court, that, in the
  investigation of the occurrence upon which were founded the
  bills for murder against William Robertson and Pierre Lukin,
  esquires, Colonel Macintosh and Captain Temple, they have fully
  and impartially examined into all the circumstances of the case,
  and the result of their proceedings is the conviction, that no
  ground exists for any criminal charge against those individuals.
  In such an instance as the present, where violent agitation has
  convulsed society, the grand jury are compelled by a sense of
  duty, beyond the mere rejection of the bills, to endeavour at
  allaying excitement, by an expression of the knowledge at which
  they have arrived after a severe inquiry into the transaction.

  'However much the grand jury may deplore the fatal consequences
  which flowed from the introduction of an armed force on that
  occasion, they feel persuaded that it was fully justified by
  the conjuncture; and its timely interposition, in their belief,
  averted the calamities which must have ensued if the rioters had
  been suffered to pursue their impetuous and destructive course.

  'With this view of the case, the grand jury cannot withhold the
  public declaration of their opinion, that the conduct observed,
  as well by the magistrates as by the military authorities, during
  those events, is worthy of commendation at the hands of those
  who love peace and respect the laws; while the inhabitants of
  the city of Montreal, in particular, are deeply indebted to the
  firm discharge by those gentlemen of their respective duties,
  for restoration to a state of security and for the protection of
  their lives and property.'


  GENERAL ORDER.

  '_Head Quarters_,
  '_Quebec, 2nd September, 1832_.

  'On the 21st of May last, a detachment of the FIFTEENTH regiment,
  commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh, having under his orders
  Captain Temple of the same regiment, was called out by the
  magistrates of Montreal, for the purpose of aiding the civil
  power in the suppression of a riot in that city, by which the
  lives and property of the inhabitants were endangered; and the
  magistrates having failed in their efforts to restore order by
  other means, the troops were required to make use of their arms,
  on which occasion three individuals were unfortunately killed,
  and others wounded.

  'The loss of life caused by the fire of the troops is an event
  deeply to be deplored, and the Commander of the Forces is
  persuaded that throughout the colony there are not to be found
  any individuals who more sincerely and more sensibly lament that
  event than Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh, Captain Temple, and those
  very soldiers whose painful duty it was to make use of their arms
  on the 21st of May. It is, however, consoling to reflect that
  the riot was suppressed without a further sacrifice of human
  life, which there was every reason to apprehend; and perhaps very
  many of the peaceable inhabitants of the city of Montreal are
  at this moment indebted for the preservation of their lives and
  property, to the timely interference of the troops acting under
  the direction of the magistrates.

  'Although the Commander of the Forces was disposed to place
  the greatest reliance on the discretion and judgment of
  Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh, and upon the steadiness and discipline
  of the regiment under his command, his Lordship, nevertheless,
  considered it to be incumbent upon him to suspend the judgment
  in regard to the events of the 21st of May, until the whole
  of the circumstances connected with those events should have
  undergone the fullest investigation before the proper tribunals
  of the country, whose duty it is to take cognizance of criminal
  offences.

  'This duty has now been performed, and Lieut.-Colonel
  Macintosh, Captain Temple, and the troops under their command,
  in suppressing the riot at Montreal on the 21st of May last,
  having been absolved from all blame, the Commander of the
  Forces hastens to embrace the opportunity thus afforded him,
  to convey to Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh, Captain Temple, and the
  non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the FIFTEENTH regiment,
  employed in the suppression of a riot at Montreal on the 21st
  of May last, his approbation of the judgment, steadiness, and
  discipline, displayed by them in their respective stations on
  that occasion.'

An address was likewise presented to Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh
and Captain Temple, by the citizens of Montreal, from which the
following extracts are made:--

  'Gentlemen--We, the subscribers, citizens of Montreal, feel it a
  duty that we owe to you, to express our thanks for your conduct
  and that of the troops under your command, on the occasion of
  your being called upon to restore and preserve the public peace,
  so unhappily broken, at the close of the poll for the election of
  a member for the west ward of this city on the 21st of May last.

  'So strong was our conviction of the importance of the services
  rendered by you and the magistrates on that occasion, that our
  desire was to have expressed our testimony of them immediately
  upon their occurrence; but considerations arising from the
  interposition of judicial authority prompted us to defer it.

  'These considerations having now been removed in a manner
  the most satisfactory to you and to ourselves, we beg most
  respectfully to convey to you this expression of the obligation
  we feel we are under to you for the safety, that we then, and
  have since, enjoyed in our persons and property through your
  means; for that it is to the military, and to the magistrates,
  that we owe our preservation, has been manifestly brought to
  light before the grand jury, by their finding and presentments
  lately returned into the Court of King's Bench.

  'We have only further to express a regret that the performance of
  a necessary but painful duty, should have subjected any one of
  you to unpleasant and unmerited restraint.'

The following letter from the Military Secretary of the General
Commanding in Chief, addressed to Lieut.-General Lord Aylmer,
_K.C.B._, Commander of the Forces in Canada, was published in the
General Orders of the Colony:--

  '_Horse Guards, Oct. 23rd, 1832._

  'MY LORD,

  'I have had the honor to receive and submit to the General
  Commanding in Chief, your Lordship's despatches of the 30th July
  and 7th September last, conveying, for Lord Hill's information,
  reports of what had taken place in consequence of a detachment
  of the FIFTEENTH Regiment of Foot, under the command of
  Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh and Captain Temple, called out in aid
  of the civil power at Montreal on the 21st of May last, having
  been compelled to resort to the use of their arms, by which,
  unfortunately, three persons were killed, and several wounded.
  The General Commanding in Chief, equally with your Lordship,
  laments the loss of life upon the occasion adverted to; but, in
  justice to Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh and Captain Temple, feels
  bound to say, after an attentive perusal of all the papers
  bearing upon the case, that he knows no instance in which troops
  have been employed in the suppression of riots, where greater
  judgment, discretion, or humanity, has been displayed; and
  if these officers have since been annoyed by accusations of
  murder, and by every proceeding which could tend to keep alive
  anxiety, they have at least the consolation of feeling that they
  have discharged a painful but imperative duty, with temper and
  moderation, and that by so doing they put an end to disorders,
  which would probably have led to consequences most disastrous to
  the city of Montreal.

  (Signed) 'FITZROY SOMERSET.'

In the month of June of this year, the colony was visited by that
afflicting scourge, the Asiatic cholera. One of the very first
individuals attacked was a sentry on the regimental guard; he was
relieved from his post, complaining of the usual symptoms, and
despite the most prompt attention, he expired in a few hours.
From this time the utmost consternation prevailed in the city,
the disease making rapid progress: the deaths were one in ten of
the whole population, without distinction of age or rank. Several
men were hourly admitted into hospital, where death very shortly
ended their sufferings. The hospital serjeant and all the orderlies
(several of whom had volunteered to assist their unfortunate
comrades) fell sacrifices to their zeal, when the disease was
on the decline. One man only, who was in the worst stage of the
disease, finally survived. It is worthy of remark that none of the
officers were in the least affected, although their duties exposed
them constantly, by day and night, to an infected atmosphere.

In order to give increased ventilation in the barracks, as well
as to relieve the attention of the soldiers, a large detachment,
chiefly of married men, was sent to La Prairie to occupy an old
cavalry barrack there; but this step proved fatal to many of them.
It was shortly after determined to remove the whole regiment to
the Island of St. Helen's, opposite to the city, where the men
were encamped. Thirty-seven men died of this scourge between the
12th and 24th of June, 1832, but not a single case occurred after
the regiment was placed under canvass. Lieut.-Colonel Macintosh
proceeded to England, and did not again rejoin the regiment, having
exchanged to half-pay with Lieut.-Colonel G. W. Horton.

[Sidenote: 1833]

The regiment was moved to Kingston, Upper Canada, in the spring of
this year, where it had been stationed on first arriving in the
colony, detaching one company to Brockville in aid of the civil
power, and a company to Cornwall, where some public works were in
course of construction.

[Sidenote: 1834]

The FIFTEENTH moved this year to Toronto, the seat of Government in
Upper Canada, detaching one company to Fort George and another to
Amherstburg, frontier posts; and a subaltern's party proceeded to
Penetanquishene, the most advanced military post on Lake Huron. The
Canadas were again visited this year by the Asiatic cholera; the
regiment, however, did not suffer in the least.

[Sidenote: 1835]

Lieut.-Colonel G. W. Horton, from the half-pay, _vice_ Macintosh,
assumed the command of the regiment.

[Sidenote: 1836]

During the year 1836 the detachments at Fort George and
Amherstburg, were relieved by companies from head quarters.

[Sidenote: 1837]

In the year 1837 all the detachments were withdrawn, and the
regiment moved to Quebec, in expectation of returning to England:
the unsettled state of the Canadas, however, called for an
increased force, and the regiment remained in that garrison during
the autumn and winter of 1837.

The importance of the citadel at a time when a rebellion had
actually broken out, and the population of the place hostile to
the government, caused the duty of the garrison to bear heavily
upon the regiment, which, with two companies of the sixty-sixth
regiment, two companies of artillery, and a battalion of volunteer
militia, raised on the emergency, formed the whole force for the
protection of this important place.

[Sidenote: 1838]

On the 9th May, several ships of war were announced by telegraph;
and they shortly after anchored opposite the citadel, having on
board the Governor-General, the Earl of Durham, and suite, and
a brigade of guards, consisting of upwards of 1600 men, under
Major-General Sir James Macdonnell.

The regiment immediately vacated its quarters and proceeded to
Chambly, on the river Richelieu, an important post, as being
situated in the centre of a populous and disaffected country.

Two drafts consisting of 226 men joined from the depôt companies,
nearly 100 of them volunteers from the nineteenth regiment. New
accoutrements were supplied, and all unserviceable arms were
likewise replaced.

Lieut.-Colonel Horton resigned the command of the regiment, and
proceeded to England in the month of June, at which time two troops
of the seventh hussars were added to the garrison of Chambly.

Lieut.-Colonel Lord Charles Wellesley, who exchanged from half-pay
with Lieut.-Colonel Horton, arrived in Canada, and assumed the
command of the regiment in October, 1838.

On the 18th of October the head-quarter division of the first (or
King's) dragoon guards, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel the
Honorable George Cathcart, replaced the squadron of the seventh
hussars. About midnight, a fire was discovered in the centre of the
officers' quarters, which consisted of a long range of buildings of
one story only, but being very old, and entirely of wood, they were
consumed in less than half an hour. The regiment had to deplore the
loss of the two senior Ensigns (Walter Carey and William Dering
Adair Roe), the fire having originated in the particular porch in
which their quarters were situated. Ensign Carey had got clear of
all danger, but incautiously attempted to secure a favourite object
of value, when he sank in the midst of the burning mass. Ensign Roe
was rescued from the flames, apparently not much burnt; he walked
nearly half a mile to the hospital without assistance, but died in
the course of the day, mortification having rapidly taken place:
the unfortunate sufferers were committed to the same tomb, and a
tablet was erected to their memory in the parish church, by their
brother officers, as a mark of their regard, and of deep regret at
their untimely fate. The cause of the fire could not be ascertained.

Although the revolt of 1837 had been put down, another attempt to
wrest the colony from the control of the Supreme Government was
known to be in agitation; and, as the line of the Richelieu was
the most disaffected, several parties of the military forces were
employed in searching for arms, and apprehending suspected persons.
About mid-day of the 8th November, an unexpected order was received
to move the chief part of the regiment to St. John's, (where a
detachment of 100 men had been stationed for some time,) and
although the weather was most inclement, the regiment reached its
destination shortly after dark.

His Excellency Lieut.-General Sir John Colborne, now Lord Seaton,
Commander of the Forces and Governor-in-Chief, was there in person,
with the whole of his staff. The seventy-third regiment had also
been brought from Montreal.

A large body of insurgents having taken possession of a village
near the frontier, their sympathizing friends in the United States
endeavoured to open a communication with them and join them; that,
being united, they might act with more effect against the isolated
positions occupied by the troops: in this object they were,
however, frustrated by the timely approach of the Commander of the
Forces in person.

As the troops advanced, the country was deserted by the misguided
inhabitants, who did not anticipate the immediate consequences
of their disaffection, and on arriving near the village of
Napierville, where the rebels were said to be in force, it was
discovered that they had dispersed; nor could they afterwards be
brought to face the troops in any single instance. A small party,
however, of volunteers, signalized themselves by attacking a
superior force of the disaffected, who in their turn became the
aggressors, but they were repulsed, and dispersed with great loss.

The troops were cantoned for a few days in the immediate
neighbourhood of Napierville, during which the misguided habitans
sheltered themselves in the woods, submitting their property to the
pillage of the soldiery, who were living at free quarters during
the time.

An irruption being threatened by the sympathizers, at a place
called Hemingford, a short distance from the frontier, but on the
opposite side of the Richelieu, the Commander of the Forces moved
there, accompanied by a division of the FIFTEENTH and seventy-third
regiments, some artillery, and two troops of the first (or King's)
dragoon guards.

The loyal portion of the inhabitants were speedily formed, and
prepared to assist the troops in acting as circumstances might
require. But the activity of the Commander of the Forces checked
the ardour of the marauders, who never fairly made their appearance.

During the remainder of the month of November, the regiment was
employed in searching for arms, throughout the counties bordering
on the Richelieu, and succeeded in securing large quantities of
them, after which service the corps returned to Chambly.

[Sidenote: 1839]

The head-quarters were again moved in December to St. John's, and
from thence to the Isle aux Noix, sending two companies to take
post at Napierville, thus occupying the frontier line. But one
occasion offered for proving the alacrity and discipline of the
regiment. An order was received about eleven o'clock, A.M., on the
5th January, to move two hundred and fifty to Henryville, a small
hamlet to the east of the Richelieu, with all possible despatch;
and the division, in complete marching order, arrived at its
destination before sunset; although the distance was only seven
miles, the march had to be performed through uncleared woods, and
over roads in many places breast-deep in snow, where the men were
obliged to file in single rank. The sixty-sixth regiment, and some
companies of the grenadier guards, together with a half battery
of artillery, were already concentrated there, under the command
of Major-General Sir James Macdonnell. The promptness of this
forward movement, however, deterred the marauders from effecting
their nefarious designs; and the troops shortly returned to their
several stations.

The regiment moved to Montreal, and took up quarters at the island
of St. Helen's, withdrawing the companies at Napierville, but
detaching two companies to William Henry, and one to Three Rivers.

During the summer, the regiment suffered severely from ophthalmia,
and although situated most favourably (the rapid and clear stream
of the St. Lawrence perpetually flowing round the island), and
unremittingly watched by the staff and regimental surgeons, the
disease was not eradicated.

[Sidenote: 1840]

The service companies returned to England on the 25th June of
this year, on board the "Athol" troopship, and disembarked at
Portsmouth, where the depôt companies awaited their arrival.

[Sidenote: 1841]

The regiment was quartered at the Haslar and Fort Monckton
barracks, until January, 1841, when it marched to Winchester. From
thence it was moved to Woolwich in June, detaching three companies
to Deptford.

[Sidenote: 1842]

The FIFTEENTH moved to Windsor early in the month of April,
where the regiment remained until November. On being relieved by
a battalion of the grenadier guards, the regiment proceeded to
Manchester, the head-quarters moving shortly after to Chester
Castle.

Whilst stationed at Windsor, the regiment was highly honored by the
personal inspection of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, and her
August Consort, the Prince Albert.

Her Majesty, on another occasion, reviewed the regiment in the Home
Park, attended by H.R.H. the Prince Albert, and the Hereditary
Grand Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha.

Her Majesty was, on both occasions, most graciously pleased to
express her approbation of the appearance of the men, and the
precision of their movements.

The half-yearly inspection of the regiment, by Lieut.-General Sir
John Macdonald, _G.C.B._, Adjutant-General to the Forces, took
place in the Home Park at Windsor, on the 22nd of July. He was
pleased to approve highly of the interior discipline and appearance
of the regiment.

At this period, upwards of five hundred men had been recruited
for the regiment since its return from Canada, and fifty-eight
volunteers were furnished to the following corps this year, namely,
to the forty-second royal Highland regiment, the ninety-seventh

SUCCESSION OF COLONELS

OF THE

FIFTEENTH, OR YORKSHIRE EAST RIDING REGIMENT OF FOOT.


SIR WILLIAM CLIFTON, BART.

_Appointed 22nd June, 1685._

WILLIAM CLIFTON succeeded, on the decease of his uncle, in January,
1675, to the dignity of Baronet, of Clifton in Nottinghamshire.
On the breaking out of the rebellion of James Duke of Monmouth,
he evinced loyalty to King James II., and interested himself in
raising a regiment for His Majesty's service, now the FIFTEENTH
foot, of which he was appointed colonel, by commission dated the
22nd of June, 1685. When tranquillity was restored, he retired from
the service, and was not afterwards employed in a military capacity.


ARTHUR HERBERT.

_Appointed 12th May, 1686._

ARTHUR HERBERT (son of Sir Edward Herbert, attorney-general to
King Charles I., and afterwards keeper of the great seal) was
educated for the naval service, and after serving in subordinate
commissions, he had the command of a squadron before Tangier; he
afterwards was at the head of a fleet sent against Algiers, and
obtained the reputation of an able naval commander. King James II.
gave him the colonelcy of a corps of musketeers and pikemen, now
the FIFTEENTH foot; but afterwards deprived him of his commission
for opposition to the measures of the court. He proceeded to
Holland, and was well received by the Prince of Orange, who
nominated him Admiral of the Dutch fleet which accompanied His
Highness to England in the autumn of 1688, when the revolution
was accomplished. When the Prince and Princess of Orange were
elevated to the throne, Admiral Herbert was raised to the peerage
by the title of Baron Torbay and EARL OF TORRINGTON, his creation
bearing date the 29th of May, 1689. He was also constituted first
commissioner of the Admiralty, commander-in-chief of the fleet, and
colonel of a regiment of marines, which was afterwards disbanded.
He commanded the British shipping in a sharp engagement with the
French, in Bantry-bay, in the summer of 1689; he also commanded the
British fleet in the disastrous naval action off Beachy-head, in
the summer of 1690; and was afterwards committed to the Tower on
suspicion of treachery, in consequence of his not having brought
the British fleet gallantly into action, which occasioned the Dutch
shipping to sustain severe loss in contest with superior numbers.
He was brought to trial before a court-martial, and acquitted;
but he was removed from his appointments, and was not afterwards
employed in the service of his sovereign. He died in April, 1716.

own company. He also served in the foot guards in the early part
of the reign of King James II., who promoted him to the colonelcy
of a corps of infantry, now the FIFTEENTH foot. At the revolution
in 1688, he adhered to the interest of the Stuart dynasty,
and refusing to take the oath to the Prince of Orange, he was
superseded in the command of his regiment. He died in 1741.

_Appointed 31st December, 1688._

He served against the rebels under the Duke of Monmouth, in the
summer of 1685; was at the battle of Sedgemoor; and was rewarded
by King James II. with the lieut.-colonelcy of the Queen Dowager's
regiment. Joining the interests of the Prince of Orange, at the
Revolution, he was nominated colonel of the FIFTEENTH foot, with
which corps he served against the insurgent clans in Scotland, and
also under King William III., in Flanders. He commanded a brigade
at the attack of Fort Kenoque in 1695; and was afterwards engaged
in the defence of Dixmude, where he yielded to the suggestions of
the governor, and voted, in a council of war, for the surrender
of the town, for which he was cashiered, by sentence of a general
court-martial. The governor, the Dutch General Ellemberg, was
beheaded at Ghent.


EMANUEL HOWE.

_Appointed 1st November, 1695._

EMANUEL HOWE, brother of Viscount Howe, of Ireland, served under
King William III., in the Netherlands, in the first foot guards,
in which corps he was advanced to captain and lieut.-colonel. In
the autumn of 1695, His Majesty nominated Lieut.-Colonel Howe, to
the colonelcy of the FIFTEENTH foot, with which corps he served
during the remainder of the war. In the reign of Queen Anne he was
employed in a diplomatic capacity, and was several years envoy
extraordinary at the court of Hanover. He was promoted to the rank
of major-general in 1707, and to that of lieut.-general in the

under King William III. He also served with reputation in the wars
of Queen Anne, and was promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy of the
thirty-ninth foot, with which corps he embarked for Portugal in
1707. He served the campaign of 1708, on the frontiers of Portugal,

gallantry at the battle of the Caya. He served in Portugal during
the remainder of the war; was promoted to the rank of colonel in
1711; and at the peace of Utrecht, accompanied his regiment to

rewarded, in 1749, with the colonelcy of the FIFTEENTH foot. In
April, 1756, he was removed to the ninth dragoons. He died in the
following month.


JEFFERY AMHERST.

_Appointed 22nd May, 1756._

JEFFERY AMHERST attached himself in early life to the profession of
arms, and in 1745 he was appointed captain and lieut.-colonel in
the first foot guards. In 1756 he was promoted to the colonelcy of
the FIFTEENTH foot; and in 1758 he was nominated commander-in-chief
in North America (with the local rank of lieut.-general), and
colonel-in-chief of the sixtieth regiment: in the following year he
was promoted to the rank of major-general.

The achievements of the British forces in North America, during the
period he was commander-in-chief in that country, are inscribed on

American regiment of foot. He was advanced to the peerage by the
title of BARON AMHERST of Holmesdale, in the county of Kent, in

removed to the FIFTEENTH in the following year: in 1777 he was
promoted to the rank of lieut.-general. He died in November, 1778.


SIR WILLIAM FAWCETT, K.B.

_Appointed 12th November, 1778._

WILLIAM FAWCETT, descended from the ancient family of Fawcetts,
of Shipden Hall, near Halifax, having, from his early youth, a
strong predilection for a military life, his friends procured him
an ensign's commission in General Oglethorp's regiment, which was
stationed in Georgia; but a British force having been sent to
Flanders in 1742, he resigned his commission, proceeded to the
continent, and, serving as a volunteer, was at the battles of
Dettingen and Fontenoy, where his gallantry attracted admiration;
and he was appointed ensign in a regiment raised by Colonel
Johnstone, with which he served until the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 1748, when it was disbanded.

Being now unemployed, he engaged in the service of a mercantile
establishment in the city of London; but finding his propensity to
a military life invincible, he subsequently purchased an ensign's
commission in the foot guards, and, by a strict attention to his
duties, procured the favour of his Royal Highness William Duke of
Cumberland, who gave him the adjutancy of the second battalion of
the third foot guards, which he held together with a lieutenantcy,
which gave him the rank of captain. Neglecting no opportunity of
qualifying himself for the highest posts in his profession, he
studied the German and French languages, acquired a knowledge of
Prussian and French tactics; and in 1757 published a translation of
the 'Memoirs upon the Art of War, by Marshal Count de Saxe,' and
'The Regulations for Prussian Cavalry;' and, in 1759, 'Regulations
for the Prussian Infantry,' and 'The Prussian Tactics.' These works
met with great attention, and a new edition in 1760 was also well
received.

In the early part of the Seven Years' War, Captain Fawcett served
in Germany as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Grenville Elliott,
where he acquired increased knowledge of the military art; and his
ardour, intrepidity, and attention to the duties of his situation,
were such, that on the decease of Lieutenant-General Grenville
Elliott, Captain Fawcett was recommended for the appointment of
aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, and he had also the
offer of the same appointment to the Marquis of Granby; he chose
the latter, and was sent to England with the despatches which
gave the account of the victory at Warbourg; on which occasion,
King George II. was highly gratified at having the particulars of
this engagement related to him in the German language by Captain
Fawcett. He was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in
the army on the 25th of November, 1760; and, continuing to serve
in Germany, was appointed military secretary to the Marquis of
Granby. It is recorded that, in Lieutenant-Colonel Fawcett's
character, strength and softness were happily blended together,
and to coolness, intrepidity, and extensive military knowledge, he
added all the requisite talents of a man of business, and the most
persevering assiduity. He was highly esteemed by every officer on
the staff of the army, and was the intimate and confidential friend
of the Marquis of Granby. He remained on service until the peace
in 1763, when he returned to England; and his knowledge of the
German language, with the information he possessed from his late
office, was the occasion of his being employed by King George III.
as commissary to settle the claims made by the Allies against Great
Britain for the expenses of the war.

In November, 1767, he obtained a company in the third foot guards;
and in 1772 he was promoted to the rank of colonel in the army, and
nominated deputy adjutant-general of the forces.

At the commencement of the American war, Colonel Fawcett was sent
to Germany, to negotiate with the states of Hesse, Hanover, and
Brunswick, for a body of troops to serve in British pay. In 1776 he
was appointed governor of Gravesend and Tilbury-fort; was promoted
to major-general in 1777, and nominated colonel of the FIFTEENTH
foot in 1778: in 1781 he was constituted adjutant-general of the
forces. The rank of lieut.-general was conferred upon this valuable
servant of the crown in 1782; in 1786 His Majesty honored him with
the riband of the Order of the Bath, and in 1792, gave him the
colonelcy of the third, or Prince of Wales's, dragoon guards.

In May, 1796, Sir William Fawcett received the rank of general,
and was appointed governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, in
July following. The duties of adjutant-general requiring greater
exertions than his health would admit of, he obtained the King's
permission to resign, and on retiring from office His Majesty
honored him with distinguished marks of his royal favour and
approbation. In 1799 Sir William Fawcett was appointed general on
the staff, and performed the duties of commander-in-chief during
the absence of the Duke of York on the continent.

He died in March, 1804, and his funeral was honored with the
presence of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, their Royal
Highnesses the Dukes of York, Clarence, Kent, and Cambridge, and of
many noblemen and general officers.


JAMES HAMILTON.

_Appointed 22nd August, 1792._

This officer served with reputation in the reign of King George
II., and in 1761 he took an active part in raising the 113th

and he was placed on half-pay; he was promoted to the rank of
lieut.-colonel in May, 1772, and appointed to the twenty-first

served with reputation in the American war; was promoted to
the rank of colonel in 1780; to that of major-general in 1787;
appointed colonel of the FIFTEENTH regiment in 1792, and removed to
the twenty-first in 1794. He obtained the rank of lieut.-general in
1797, and that of general in 1802. His decease occurred in 1803.


HENRY WATSON POWELL.

_Appointed 20th June, 1794._

captain of a company in the second battalion of the eleventh foot,
which battalion was numbered the sixty-fourth regiment in 1758. In
1770 he obtained the majority of the thirty-eighth, and in 1771 the
lieut.-colonelcy of the fifty-third, at the head of which corps he
served in the American war. He was promoted to the rank of colonel
in 1779, and to that of major-general in 1782; in 1792 he obtained
the colonelcy of the sixty-ninth regiment, from which he was
removed in 1794 to the FIFTEENTH foot. In 1796 he obtained the rank
of lieut.-general, and that of general in 1801. He died in 1814.

_Appointed 23rd July, 1814._

This officer commenced his career in the army, as an ensign in the
grenadier guards, on the 17th April, 1783, and served with them
to the close of the American war. He was promoted lieutenant and
captain on the 3rd June, 1791, and from the end of 1793 till the
return of the army in May, 1795, he served under his Royal Highness

actions between those periods. On the 12th June, 1795, he succeeded
to a company, with the rank of lieut.-colonel; on the 29th April,

the Home Staff in December, 1805. In July, 1806, he commanded
a battalion of the foot guards in Sicily; in August, 1807, was
appointed brigadier-general in Sicily; and in 1808 joined the army
in Spain under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, where he commanded a
brigade in the reserve, and was present at the battle of Corunna,
for which he obtained a medal. He commanded the first brigade of
foot guards on the Walcheren expedition in July, 1809, and on the
25th October following was promoted to the rank of major-general.
In 1810 he was ordered to Cadiz as second in command, and in the
succeeding year was appointed to the command there. On the 4th
June, 1814, he was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-general,
and on the 23rd July of that year His Majesty King George III.
conferred on him the colonelcy of the FIFTEENTH regiment; and on

Most Honorable Military Order of the Bath. He was promoted to the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
